Head contains meta information, the title of the page, internal style, external stylesheet link, internal javascript, 
external JavaScript file linking, etc. The head is not required to be present in the document, but it is recommended to be present.
There should only be one head in an HTML document.

The Head is a block of information that is placed at the top of the document. The head is the first section of the document 
and contains information that is shared by all the pages in the document. Head is not used to add information to 
the body of the HTML document. This is because the body is the second part of the HTML document and is used to add content 
to the HTML document.

Head usually contains this <meta>, <title>, <style>, <link>, <base>, and <script>-->

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Steven Wang. I have graduated from California University of Long Beach in Spring 2019 with a Bachelors with a Computer Engineering degree. I worked at Volunteers of America ever since working as a IT handling with computers and inventory.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I learned two programming languages and applied them normally: First came with C++ and then after I started learning Javascript. It then became a passion for me because it allows me to build programs that is normally not done. While I self-learned C++, I learned Javascript through a website called www.freecodecamp.org. It provides challenging projects and lessons that provides learning Javascript much better through real applications and examples. I also have hands-on experience onto others such as Python, C#, MATLAB, and Verilog</p> 
            <p>With Javascript, so far I learned Bootstrap framework and JQuery library.</p>   
            <p>To be able to learn and apply my programming skills, I decided to build several projects to enhance my coding skills. Which can be seen in the Projects tab</p>
            <p>I learn how to use a source control /version history of Git which helps me retain versions of my source code in case of disasters</p>
            <p>On my freetime, I do a variety such as Drawing, Programming, and looking at Math, Physics, and Computer.</p>
            <p>Overtime, I am learning new things every single day!</p>
            <p>I am open to any work opportunitites that is related to programming and many others! I am capable of learning new technologys, tools, and even programming languages along the way. The possibilities are endless!</p>
