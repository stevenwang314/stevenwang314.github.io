<!--Head is the first part of the HTML document that is used to add additional information to the HTML document.
Head contains meta information, the title of the page, internal style, external stylesheet link, internal javascript, 
external JavaScript file linking, etc. The head is not required to be present in the document, but it is recommended to be present.
There should only be one head in an HTML document.

The Head is a block of information that is placed at the top of the document. The head is the first section of the document 
and contains information that is shared by all the pages in the document. Head is not used to add information to 
the body of the HTML document. This is because the body is the second part of the HTML document and is used to add content 
to the HTML document.

Head usually contains this <meta>, <title>, <style>, <link>, <base>, and <script>-->

        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello world, and of course YOU!, my name is Steven Wang. I have recently graduated from California University of Long Beach in Spring 2019 with a Bachelors with a Computer Engineering degree. Throughout my journeys in college, I have done several hands-on projects in between both software and hardware and making things happen.</p>
            <p>I worked at Volunteers of America with my role is to maintain computers and handling an inventory database. Ever since I worked over 
                there, I have developed personal skills from work and myself that universally carries over between now and future. 
                I have dealt with configuring computers such as creating emails for users, setting up new computers for users, as well as troubleshooting 
                computers that are not working properly. I also disposed old and broken computers away by destroying hard drives to prevent misuse of data
                that could leak from elsewhere. I also have an inventory that contains devices that are currently in use or no longer in use.  
                I worked alongside other workers to be able to solve any issues with computers while being able to finish within a deadline.</p>
            <p>On the other side of myself, I have learned two programming languages which are C++ and JavaScript. I also have some hands-on experience onto other languages such as Python, C, C#, MATLAB, and Verilog. .</p>
            <p>I first started learned C++ from a book from my local library as well as during college. Eventually, I first learned how to use a low-level API which is the Windows Operating System that allowed me to build desktop programs which further enhanced my programming skills as well as making projects out of them. I used a graphics API called Direct2D which that incorporates with Windows API allows me to build graphical applications expanding the possibilities of programming as a whole as a whole as well as further enhancing my skills in the field.</p>
            <p>Next came with Javascript which allows me to build websites, like this one you are looking at right now! It also started by reading a Javascript book from the library and then eventually one of my colleagues recommended me a website called www.freecodecamp.org to learn Javascript. There, it has several challenging projects and courses that provides learning Javascript much better. It doesnâ€™t stop there, I also applied what I learned to build a program of my own liking to test my own newly learned Javascript.</p>
            <p>Throughout my journeys with Javascript, I currently learned how to develop front end with Bootstrap, JQuery, React, and Sass library, and back end with Node.js alongside Express and Mongoose to build web pages or server-sided programs <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/stevenwang1"> Here is my profile of me on freecodecamp on what I have done.</a></p>
            <p>To be able to keep a history of my own additions and editing between my projects as well as transferring over to different devices. I have picked up Git which helps me retain versions of my source code as well as receiving up-to-date code without the need to transfer my projects from USB. It also helps me revert changes when something does not go right.</p>
            <p>To see all my projects I have done from school to now, click on the Projects link for more information.</p>
            <p>On my free time, I like to draw, walking, listening to music, watching informational videos, and coding fun personal projects.</p>
            <p>I am currently programming a program on my free time on this day! I am open to any programming opportunities whether its software , hardware, or any.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: this website is created through coding with Javascript, HTML, and CSS!</p>
