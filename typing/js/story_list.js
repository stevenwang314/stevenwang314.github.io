const story_intro = `Hello world, welcome to the typing game. I am Steven Wang, the creator of this typing project.
Let's go over the things about typing.
What is typing?
Typing is an essential part of almost every job imaginable out there.
It helps people complete work faster and more efficiently, be more comfortable on the computer,
and help communicate with coworkers and superiors. Attempting to type something for long periods of time can
cause fatigue and restlessness so it is very beneficial for someone's health as well as managing good typing skills
and slowly increase their typing speed by practicing every day.
Speed isn't the most important thing when getting the work done.
There are also considerations of needs to type accurately, concisely and understandability.
To be able to improve typing is to practice, practice, and practice more on typing each day to improve those three considerations.
Benefits of Typing
Learning to type fast and accurately will help people in many ways in life, and it should be considered an
essential skill for anyone who sees themselves working with a computer in some capacity (which is most people).
1) Save Time: The faster someone types, the more time saved. When asked to type up a report or even send an email.
Should the person type very quickly while remaining accurate and precise, it can allow people to save extra time.
2) Be More Productive: If the person can learn to double the rate of speed of typing, it can get essentially
twice as much done in the same period of time. Employees around the world want to ensure employees are
trained up in touch-typing due to productivity boost it could lead to.
3) Improving Posture: In an office-based role, most of the time is spent sitting at the desk attempting to type away things.
Everybody knows that sitting down at your desk for long period of time without break is bad for posture, so it makes sense to
reduce the amount of time needed to sit down.
If a lot of time spent is sitting at the desk, it can improve one's poster and health by increasing typing speed.
Less time spent on desk while more time spent standing up and stretching to not hurt their back, neck, and shoulders.
When learning to type, they can also learn correct typing posture. It is important to sit up properly in order to stop the
neck from becoming stiff and prevent wrist from causing pain. Eventually, the person will become aware of correct posture
when learning to type properly and will not have to keep looking down at the keyboard which gives the neck a break and reduces aching.
4) Better Accuracy: With better accuracy means less time checking for mistakes in writing and correcting them,
which means saving more time and making less work for them. It also reduces the occurrence of mistakes sneaking
into the final version of document.
5) Find more opportunities: When applying for a job, typing fast and accurately can put a candidate in a big advantage.
Employers like to know that their employees can type properly because it makes them more productive and improve their accuracy of work.
Essentially, make sure to clearly state word per minute (WPM) on resume to impress prospective employers and can find more opportunities
that come the way.
Now that you see how typing is vital into the real world and becomes more and more in demand as computer-based jobs become more popular.
Typing fast and accurate is a powerful skill that can be learned and improved by taking some time typing each day to improve Words per Minute
and Accuracy. In this case we usually go for 100 percent all the time!
Good luck and have fun typing!`;

const article_computer = `What Is a Computer?
A computer is a programmable electronic device capable of processing information.
Composed of hardware and software, computers operate on two levels: they receive data
through an input route, either live or through a digital storage unit, and send out an output.
How Does a Computer Work?
A computer processes the input to produce the desired output, but how does a machine outperform the human brain?
Conventional computers don't try to mimic the human brain. Instead, they run commands sequentially,
with data constantly moving from input and memory
to the device's processor. Neuromorphic computers, on the other hand, process data at the same time,
making them faster, energy-efficient, and closer to the structure of the human brain.
Overall, a computer works in four steps:
1. Input: Input is the data before processing. It comes from the mouse, keyboard, microphone, and other external sensors.
2. Storage: The storage is how the computer retains input data. The hard drive is used for long-term and mass data
storage while the data set for immediate processing is stored temporarily in the Random Access Memory (RAM).
3. Processing: Processing is where input gets transformed into output. The computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU) is its brain.
It's responsible for executing instructions and performing mathematical operations on the input data.
4. Output: Output is the final result of data processing. It can be anything from images, video, or
audio content, even the words you type using a keyboard. You can also receive the output through a
printer or a projector instead of directly through your device.
The Hardware Components of a Computer
The more simple the task a computer has to perform, the easier it is to build. That's why older computers
are simplistic compared to their modern counterparts, with limited capabilities.
The hardware components are everything you can physically touch and see in a computer, including all the
input and output devices from keyboards, mics, and mice to screens and speakers.
Hardware is also the physical processing parts like storage, CPU, graphics card, sound card, RAM, and motherboard,
all of which play an important role in contemporary computers.
Motherboard
The motherboard is the primary communication hub between the computer's hardware components. It's the main
circuit where everything needs to physically connect-except for ones relying on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Without
a motherboard, it's impossible to have a functioning modern computer.
CPU
If the motherboard is the communications hub, then the CPU is the communications director. It receives
and interprets the input and instructions and sends out signals to other components of exactly what to do
with the data for the desired output. The more cores a CPU has, the more operations it can perform at the same time.
RAM
The RAM is the CPU's main assistant. Instead of having to fish for data in a considerably large storage
unit, RAM stores the data used by the operating system, any running software, and incoming input. The bigger
the capacity of the RAM, the more heavy-weight software it can run without slowing down the device.
HDD/SSD
HDD stands for Hard Disk Drive. It's the component that permanently stores your media and apps, including
the operating system (OS). They vary in size and performance from a few hundred gigabytes (GB) to several
terabytes (TB).
You may also encounter Solid State Drives (SSDs), which are another type of storage hardware. SSDs and HDDs
are useful for different things, and many users combine drives to maximize performance.
Graphics Processing Unit
The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is dedicated to processing visual imagery on your computer. Powerful GPUs
are essential to rendering high-quality images and graphics or playing video games. Graphics processing can
either be its own components or be integrated with the CPU.
Sound Card
Sound cards are responsible for processing auditory data and sending it to your speakers. Similarly, the
sound card can either be its separate piece or integrated with the CPU.
The Software Components of a Computer
Modern computers use a combination of hardware and software components that work together to process complex
inputs and outputs.
Software is a pre-written collection of instructions that tells your computer what to do. It's a digital program,
not a physical component that can be seen when opening the cover of a computer or laptop.
And, like your computer hardware, different types of software perform different roles in the functioning of your computer.
Firmware
Firmware is where the line between hardware and software gets blurry. It's software that's physically etched
into a piece of hardware.
Firmware is the first thing that kickstarts your computer when you switch it on, a simple program that instructs
your computer to launch the OS. Without it, your computer won't launch your operating system or other components,
and you'll be stuck with hardware that you can't communicate with.
Operating System (OS)
An operating system is a piece of software that manages your computer's hardware and software resources. Similarly,
without an OS, you can't communicate with your computer even using your input devices.
The Future of Computers
Computers that follow the sequential processing model will only get cheaper, smaller, faster, and more efficient.
However, conventional computer design and architecture are reaching their limit. Instead, you can expect a rise
in modern computing architecture that isn't reliant on technology first designed over 50 years ago, from the
prospect of Neuromorphic computers to more accessible Quantum computers.`

const article_usb = `A USB flash drive also known as a USB stick, USB thumb drive or pen drive is a
plug-and-play portable storage device that uses flash memory and is lightweight enough to attach to a keychain.
A USB flash drive can be used in place of a compact disc. When a user plugs the flash memory device into the
USB port, the computer's operating system (OS) recognizes the device as a removable drive and assigns it a drive letter.
A USB flash drive can store important files and data backups, carry favorite settings or applications,
run diagnostics to troubleshoot computer problems or launch an OS from a bootable USB.
The drives support Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS, different flavors of Linux and many BIOS boot ROMs.
The first USB flash drive came on the market in 2000 with a storage capacity of 8 megabytes (MB).
Drives now come in capacities ranging between 8 gigabytes (GB) and 1 terabyte (TB), depending on
manufacturer, and future capacity levels are expected to reach 2 TB.
The memory within most USB flash drives is multi-level cell (MLC), which is good for 3,000 to 5,000
program-erase cycles. However, some drives are designed with single-level cell (SLC) memory that
supports approximately 100,000 writes.
How a USB flash drive is used also affects its life expectancy. The more users delete and write
new data on the device, the more likely it will degrade.
USB specifications
There are three main USB specifications that USB flash drives can connect through: 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0.
Each specification publication allows for faster data transfer rates than the previous version.
There have also been several prereleases and various updates in addition to these three versions.
USB 1.0 was released in January 1996. It was available in two versions:
USB 1.0 low-speed: Provides a data transfer rate of 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps).
USB 1.0 high-speed: Has a data transfer rate of 12 Mbps.
Version 1.1, an update that fixed various issues in 1.0, was released in September 1998 and was more widely adopted.
USB 2.0, also known as Hi-Speed USB, was released in April 2000. It was developed by the USB 2.0 Promoter
Group, an organization led by Compaq, Hewlett-Packard (now Hewlett Packard Enterprise), Intel, Lucent
Technologies, Microsoft, NEC Corp. and Philips. USB 2.0 features a maximum data transfer rate of 480 Mbps.
This boosted performance by up to 40 times. It is backward-compatible so USB flash drives using original
USB technology can easily transition.
USB 3.0, also known as SuperSpeed USB, was introduced in November 2008. The first 3.0-compatible USB storage
began shipping in January 2010. SuperSpeed USB was developed by the USB Promoter Group to increase the
data transfer rate and lower power consumption. With SuperSpeed USB, the data transfer rate increased
10 times from Hi-Speed USB to 5 Gigabits per second (Gbps). It features lower power requirements when active
and idle, and is backward-compatible with USB 2.0. USB 3.1, known as SuperSpeed+ or SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps,
was released in July 2013. It bumped up the data transfer rate and improved data encoding for higher throughput.
Pros and cons of USB flash drives
USB flash drives are small and light, use little power and have no moving parts. The devices, whether they
are encased in plastic or rubber, are strong enough to withstand mechanical shocks, scratches and dust, and
generally are waterproof.
Data on USB flash drives can be retained for long periods when the device is unplugged from a computer, or
when the computer is powered-down with the drive left in. This makes a USB flash drive convenient for
transferring data between a desktop computer and a notebook computer, or for personal backup needs.
Unlike most removable drives, a USB flash drive does not require rebooting after it is attached,
does not require batteries or an external power supply, and is not platform dependent.
Several manufacturers offer additional features such as password protection and downloadable drivers
that allow the device to be compatible with older systems that do not have USB ports.
Drawbacks to USB flash drives include the ability to handle a limited number of write and erase cycles
before the drive fails, data leakage and exposure to malware. Data leakage is a problem because the
devices are portable and hard to track. A security breach due to malware can occur when the device
is plugged into an infected system. However, encryption and a routine scan of the USB flash drive
are common approaches in protecting against a security breach.
Major vendors
Examples of USB flash drive manufacturers include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Kingston Technology Corp.,
Lexar Media Inc., SanDisk, Seagate Technology, Sony Corp., Toshiba Corp. and Verbatim Americas LLC.
The best USB flash drives should let you store and keep safe your important files and documents in a tiny pocket-sized device.
And, unlike external SSDs or hard drives, they won't cost you a small fortune. These are our top picks
for every need and budget.`

const article_cellPhones = `How does a cell phone work? There are 3 things we will discuss about.
1) How cellphone calls travel?
When you speak into a cellphone, a tiny microphone in the handset converts the up-and-down sounds of
your voice into a corresponding up-and-down pattern of electrical signals. A microchip inside the phone
turns these signals into strings of numbers. The numbers are packed up into a radio wave and beamed out
from the phone's antenna (in some countries, the antenna is called an aerial). The radio wave races through
the air at the speed of light until it reaches the nearest cellphone mast.
The mast receives the signals and passes them on to its base station, which effectively coordinates what
happens inside each local part of the cellphone network, which is called a cell. From the base station,
the calls are routed onward to their destination. Calls made from a cellphone to another cellphone on the
same network travel to their destination by being routed to the base station nearest to the destination phone,
and finally to that phone itself. Calls made to a cellphone on a different network or a land line follow a
lengthier path. They may have to be routed into the main telephone network before they can reach their ultimate destination.
2) How cellphone masts help?
At first glance, cellphones seem a lot like two-way radios and walkie talkies, where each person has a radio
(containing both a sender and a receiver) that bounces messages back and forth directly, like tennis players
returning a ball. The problem with radios like this is that you can only use so many of them in a certain area
before the signals from one pair of callers start interfering with those from other pairs of callers. That's why
cellphones are much more sophisticated-and work in a completely different way.
A cellphone handset contains a radio transmitter, for sending radio signals onward from the phone, and a radio
receiver, for receiving incoming signals from other phones. The radio transmitter and receiver are not very high-powered,
which means cellphones cannot send signals very far. That's not a flaw- it's a deliberate feature of their design!
All a cellphone has to do is communicate with its local mast and base station; what the base station has to do is
pick up faint signals from many cellphones and route them onward to their destination, which is why the masts are huge,
high-powered antennas (often mounted on a hill or tall building). If we didn't have masts, we'd need cellphones with
enormous antennas and giant power supplies-and they'd be too cumbersome to be mobile. A cellphone automatically
communicates with the nearest cell (the one with the strongest signal) and uses as little power to do so as it
possibly can (which makes its battery last as long as possible and reduces the likelihood of it interfering with
other phones nearby).
3) What cells do?
So why bother with cells? Why don't cellphones simply talk to one another directly? Suppose several people in your
area all want to use their cellphones at the same time. If their phones all send and receive calls in the same way,
using the same kind of radio waves, the signals would interfere and scramble together and it would be impossible to tell
one call from another. One way to get around this is to use different radio waves for different calls. If each phone call
uses a slightly different frequency (the number of up-and-down undulations in a radio wave in one second), the calls are
easy to keep separate. They can travel through the air like different radio stations that use different wavebands.
That's fine if there are only a few people calling at once. But suppose you're in the middle of a big city and millions
of people are all calling at once. Then you'd need just as many millions of separate frequencies-more than are usually
available. The solution is to divide the city up into smaller areas, with each one served by its own masts and base
station. These areas are what we call cells and they look like a patchwork of invisible hexagons. Each cell has its
base station and masts and all the calls made or received inside that cell are routed through them. Cells enable the
system to handle many more calls at once, because each cell uses the same set of frequencies as its neighboring cells.
The more cells, the greater the number of calls that can be made at once. This is why urban areas have many more cells
than rural areas and why the cells in urban areas are much smaller.`;

const article_qwerty=`A keyboard is a very common gadget used by billions of people on an daily basis.
As you type, you may have often wondered why the keyboard layout is the way it is. There are even theories
on the internet that suggest that the QWERTY layout has a secret hidden purpose, or that it was designed to
ensure that people work at a certain rate.
However, in reality, the reason for the QWERTY layout on keyboards has an interesting and somewhat controversial
history. There are, in fact, several logical explanations for the way it was designed.
The QWERTY keyboard was introduced by American inventor and newspaper publisher, Christopher Latham Sholes.
Sholes developed a number of devices to make his businesses more efficient. One such invention was an early
typewriter, developed along with with Samuel W. Soulé, James Densmore, and Carlos Glidden, and first patented in 1868.
This early typewriter used a keyboard that resembled a piano and had 28 keys arranged alphabetically.
The idea was that this was the most efficient arrangement because users would know immediately where to find each letter.
3579NOPQRSTUVWXYZ
2468.ABCDEFGHIJKLM
Sholes received a patent for this typewriter in 1868, but he kept tinkering with the keyboard layout to find the most efficient
way to organize the keys.
In the prototype, he arranged all the typing letters in four rows. Numbers from 0 to 9 were placed in the top row followed by vowels
and punctuation marks in the second row. The rest of the alphabet was placed in the remaining two rows, with each row containing 10 letters.
23456789-
AEI.?YUO,
BCDFGHJKLM
ZXWVTSRQPN
In 1873, Sholes and his investors agrees to sell the production rights to the prototype to gun-maker Remington, which, following
the Civil War, had branched out into appliance manufacturing. The Remington company made several modifications in the original design,
including rearranging the keyboard to a somewhat familiar layout.
23456789-,
QWE.TYIUOP
ZSDFGHJKLM
AX&CVBN?;R
Just before this version went into production, the layout changed again, to the now-common QWERTY layout, apparently at the insistence
of Sholes, who patented the QWERTY arrangement in 1878. The Sholes & Glidden typewriter with the QWERTY keyboard (renamed the Remington No. 1 Type Writer)
went into production in 1874.
In 1878, Remington introduced a new model of the type writer, the No. 2. This typewriter would become the model T of typewriters, selling
100,000 units by 1890. It was also the first typewriter to come equipped with a shift key. Due to the absence of a shift key, the Remington
No. 1 model only had uppercase letters, but the shift key allowed the Remington No. 2, to use each key as both upper case and lower case.
The typewriter also allowed users to access the underside of the platen, a black rubber roller inside the typewriter carriage that was used
to prevent damage to keys.
In addition to typewriters, Remington also sold typing courses, in which it taught people how to type using its machines. Companies who wanted
to hire trained typists also had to purchase the Remington machines they were familiar with - a system that ensured a continued market for the
typewriters.
In 1893, the five largest typewriter manufacturers - Remington, Caligraph, Yost, Densmore, and Smith-Premier - merged to form the Union
Typewriter Company. They agreed that the QWERTY would be used as the standard for keyboards, sealing the fate of the QWERTY keyboard.
Why the QWERTY keyboard was Invented?
Earlier typewriters used to have keys arranged in alphabetical order, but this arrangement created several problems that led inventors
and typewriter manufacturers to look for an efficient alternative keyboard layout. Here are some contenders.
-According to one theory, the alphabetically-arranged keyboards allowed users to type at great speed, but when they pressed two
closely located keys too quickly, the levers associated with the respective keys would become jammed. Therefore, a new layout was
required that would reduce the key jamming. According to this theory, the QWERTY keyboard was designed to solve this problem with its
planned arrangement of letters in different rows. This theory, however, has been largely debunked.
-The QWERTY keyboard places keys that are commonly used in pairs close together, such as T and H or E and R, etc.  Thus, the QWERTY
style turned out to be a more convenient typing model for users and they more easily became accustomed to it due to its user-friendly design.
-A study conducted by researchers at Kyoto University in 2011, suggests the QWERTY typewriter keyboard layout was actually developed
from inputs provided by telegraph operators, who would have been the largest users of keyboards at the time. The researchers concluded
that the operators found the earlier alphabetical arrangement of the keyboard confusing and inefficient for translating morse code.
For example, Morse code represents Z as '· · · ·' which is often confused with 'SE'. The Morse receivers often could not determine whether
to use Z or SE until they received the following letters. Thus, to make it easier for the operators, S ought to be placed close to both Z
and E on the keyboard for Morse receivers to type them quickly.`

const article_solarSystem = `The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity - the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.
Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in the night sky. So far, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems
orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found. Most of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought
to have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but one of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.
While our planet is in some ways a mere speck in the vast cosmos, we have a lot of company out there. It seems that we live in a universe
packed with planets - a web of countless stars accompanied by families of objects, perhaps some with life of their own.
Namesake
There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is named the "solar system"
because our Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis," and anything related to the Sun we call "solar."
Size and Distance
Our solar system extends much farther than the eight planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies
past Neptune's orbit. This is a sparsely occupied ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object - dwarf
planet Pluto.
Beyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly
observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.
The Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris - some bigger than mountains - orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away.
This shell of material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU)
is the distance from the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). The Oort Cloud is the boundary of the Sun's
gravitational influence, where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.
The Sun's heliosphere doesn't extend quite as far. The heliosphere is the bubble created by the solar wind - a stream of electrically
charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. The boundary where the solar wind is abruptly slowed by pressure from interstellar
gases is called the termination shock. This edge occurs between 80-100 astronomical units.
Two NASA spacecraft launched in 1977 have crossed the termination shock: Voyager 1 in 2004 and Voyager 2 in 2007. Voyager 1 went interstellar
in 2012 and Voyager 2 joined it in 2018. But it will be many thousands of years before the two Voyagers exit the Oort Cloud.
Moons
There are more than 200 known moons in our solar system and several more awaiting confirmation of discovery. Of the eight planets, Mercury and
Venus are the only ones with no moons. The giant planets Jupiter and Saturn lead our solar system's moon counts. In some ways, the swarms of
moons around these worlds resemble mini versions of our solar system. Pluto, smaller than our own moon, has five moons in its orbit, including
the Charon, a moon so large it makes Pluto wobble. Even tiny asteroids can have moons. In 2017, scientists found asteroid 3122 Florence had
two tiny moons.
Formation
Our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to
the shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula - a spinning, swirling
disk of material.
At the center, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually, the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to
combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99% of
the available matter.
Matter farther out in the disk was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some
of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets, and large moons. In other cases,
planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite come together into a
planet. Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons.
Structure
The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar system is due to the way the solar system formed. Nearest to the Sun,
only rocky material could withstand the heat when the solar system was young. For this reason, the first four planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth,
and Mars - are terrestrial planets. They are all small with solid, rocky surfaces.
Meanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid, or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar system. Gravity pulled these
materials together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.`

const article_sounds = `Background
Sound is a type of energy made by vibrations. When an object vibrates, it causes movement in surrounding air molecules.
These molecules bump into the molecules close to them, causing them to vibrate as well. This makes them bump into more nearby
air molecules. This "chain reaction" movement, called sound waves, keeps going until the molecules run out of energy.
As a result, there is a series of molecular collisions as the sound wave passes through the air, but the air molecules
themselves don't travel with the wave. As it is disturbed, each molecule just moves away from a resting point but then
eventually returns to it.
Pitch and Frequency
If your ear is within range of such vibrations, you hear the sound. However, the vibrations need to be at a certain speed
in order for us to hear them. For example, we would not be able to hear the slow vibrations that are made by waving our hands
in the air. The slowest vibration human ears can hear is 20 vibrations per second. That would be a very low-pitched sound.
The fastest vibration we can hear is 20,000 vibrations per second, which would be a very high-pitched sound. Cats can hear even
higher pitches than dogs, and porpoises can hear the fastest vibrations of all (up to 150,000 times per second!). The number of
vibrations per second is referred to as an object's frequency, measured in Hertz (Hz).
Pitch is related to frequency, but they are not exactly the same. Frequency is the scientific measure of pitch. That is,
while frequency is objective, pitch is completely subjective. Sound waves themselves do not have pitch; their vibrations
can be measured to obtain a frequency, but it takes a human brain to map them to that internal quality of pitch.
The pitch of a sound is largely determined by the mass (weight) of the vibrating object. Generally, the greater the mass,
the more slowly it vibrates and the lower the pitch. However, the pitch can be altered by changing the tension or rigidity
of the object. For example, a heavy E string on an instrument can be made to sound higher than a thin E string by tightening
the tuning pegs, so that there is more tension on the string.
Nearly all objects, when hit, struck, plucked, strummed or somehow disturbed, will vibrate. When these objects vibrate, they
tend to vibrate at a particular frequency or set of frequencies. This is known as the natural frequency of the object. For example,
if you 'ping' a glass with your finger, the glass will produce a sound at a pitch that is its natural frequency. It will make
this same sound every time. This sound can be changed, however, by altering the vibrating mass of the glass. For example,
adding water causes the glass to get heavier (increase in mass) and thus harder to move, so it tends to vibrate more slowly
and at a lower pitch.
What is Sound?
When we hear something, we are sensing the vibrations in the air. These vibrations enter the outer ear and cause our eardrums
to vibrate (or oscillate). Attached to the eardrum are three tiny bones that also vibrate: the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup.
These bones make larger vibrations within the inner ear, essentially amplifying the incoming vibrations before they are picked up by
the auditory nerve.
The properties of a sound wave change when it travels through different media: gas (e.g. air), liquid (e.g. water) or solid (e.g. bone).
When a wave passes through a denser medium, it goes faster than it does through a less-dense medium. This means that sound travels
faster through water than through air, and faster through bone than through water.
When molecules in a medium vibrate, they can move back and forth or up and down. Sound energy causes the molecules to move back
and forth in the same direction that the sound is travelling. This is known as a longitudinal wave. (Transverse waves occur when
the molecules vibrate up and down, perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels).
Speaking (as well as hearing) involves vibrations. To speak, we move air past our vocal cords, which makes them vibrate. We change the
sounds we make by stretching those vocal cords. When the vocal cords are stretched we make high sounds and when they are loose we make
lower sounds. This is known as the pitch of the sound.
The sounds we hear every day are actually collections of simpler sounds. A musical sound is called a tone. If we strike a tuning fork,
it gives off a pure tone, which is the sound of a single frequency. But if we were to sing or play a note on a trumpet or violin,
the result is a combination of one main frequency with other tones. This gives each musical instrument its characteristic sound.`;

const article_marianaTrench = `While thousands of climbers have successfully scaled Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, only
two people have descended to the planet's deepest point, the Challenger Deep in the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench.
Located in the western Pacific east of the Philippines and an average of approximately 124 miles (200 kilometers) east of the Mariana
Islands, the Mariana Trench is a crescent-shaped scar in the Earth's crust that measures more than 1,500 miles (2,550 kilometers)
long and 43 miles (69 kilometers) wide on average. The distance between the surface of the ocean and the trench's deepest point-the
Challenger Deep, which lies about 200 miles (322 kilometers) southwest of the U.S. territory of Guam-is nearly 7 miles (11 kilometers).
If Mount Everest were dropped into the Mariana Trench, its peak would still be more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) underwater.
The Mariana Trench is part of a global network of deep troughs that cut across the ocean floor. They form when two tectonic plates
collide. At the collision point, one of the plates dives beneath the other into the Earth's mantle, creating an ocean trench.
The depths of the Mariana Trench were first plumbed in 1875 by the British ship H.M.S. Challenger as part of the first global
oceanographic cruise. The Challenger scientists recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (about five miles, or eight kilometers) using
a weighted sounding rope. In 1951, the British vessel H.M.S. Challenger II returned to the spot with an echo-sounder and measured
a depth of nearly 7 miles (11 kilometers).
The majority of the Mariana Trench is now a U.S. protected zone as part of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, established
by President George W. Bush in 2009. Permits for research in the monument, including in the Sirena Deep, have been secured from the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Permits for research in the Challenger Deep have been secured from the Federated States of Micronesia.
HISTORIC DIVE
Because of its extreme depth, the Mariana Trench is cloaked in perpetual darkness and the temperature is just a few degrees above
freezing. The water pressure at the bottom of the trench is a crushing eight tons per square inch-or about a thousand times the
standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. Pressure increases with depth.
The first and only time humans descended into the Challenger Deep was more than 50 years ago. In 1960, Jacques Piccard and Navy Lt.
Don Walsh reached this goal in a U.S. Navy submersible, a bathyscaphe called the Trieste. After a five-hour descent, the pair spent
only a scant 20 minutes at the bottom and were unable to take any photographs due to clouds of silt stirred up by their passage.
Until Piccard and Walsh's historic dive, scientists had debated whether life could exist under such extreme pressure. But at the bottom,
the Trieste's floodlight illuminated a creature that Piccard thought was a flatfish, a moment that Piccard would later describe with
excitement in a book about his journey.
"Here, in an instant, was the answer that biologists had asked for the decades," Piccard wrote. "Could life exist in the greatest
depths of the ocean? It could!"
WAITING IN THE DEEP
While the Trieste expedition laid to rest any doubts that life could exist in the Mariana Trench, scientists still know very little
about the types of organisms that reside there. In fact, some question whether Piccard's fish was actually a form of sea cucumber.
It is thought that the pressure is so great that calcium can't exist except in solution, so the bones of vertebrates would literally
dissolve. No bones, no fish. But nature has also proven scientists wrong many times in the past with its remarkable capacity for
adaptation. So are there fish that deep? Nobody knows, and this is the whole point of the DEEPSEA CHALLENGE project, to find answers
to such fundamental questions.
In recent years, deep-ocean dredges and unmanned subs have glimpsed exotic organisms such as shrimp-like amphipods, and strange,
translucent animals called holothurians. But scientists say there are many new species awaiting discovery and many unanswered
questions about how animals can survive in these extreme conditions. Scientists are particularly interested in microorganisms
living in the trenches, which they say could lead to breakthroughs in biomedicine and biotechnology.
The Mariana Trench's microscopic inhabitants might even shed light on the emergence of life on Earth. Some researchers, such as
Patricia Fryer et alat University of Hawaii, have speculated that serpentine mud volcanoes located near ocean trenches might have
provided the right conditions for our planet's first life-forms. Additionally, studying rocks from ocean trenches could lead to a
better understanding of the earthquakes that create the powerful and devastating tsunamis seen around the Pacific Rim, geologists say.`

const article_movie =`Watching movies can be beneficial for your mental health and serve as more than just a hobby or pastime.
Watching movies is an activity that has long been regarded as simply a pastime to enjoy when you have a free moment from life's responsibilities.
While too much screen time can be harmful, engaging in hobbies that balance your work and professional life can be healthy.
What are the benefits of watching movies?
Movies can provide several mental health benefits.
Boost mood
If you live with an anxiety disorder or depression, or you're simply anxious and stressed about work and family commitments,
taking time to watch a movie could help improve your mood.
A 2016 review found that enjoying leisure activities such as watching movies could boost mood and reduce symptoms of depression.
Relaxation
Pleasurable distractions and entertainment could provide rest and relaxation and replenishing qualities, according to a 2017 study.
Finding relaxation by watching a movie might be easier than it sounds. It might be a good idea to eliminate unnecessary distractions
during the movie.
If you have trouble disconnecting from work or other daily stressors, consider leaving your phone and other devices in another room
or on "do not disturb" mode so that you're interrupted only for urgent matters.
You might find that you're able to engage your mind with the plot you're following without distractions, which could make for a
more soothing experience.
A musical or romantic comedy, aka rom-com, could be just the distraction you need to relax after a long day.
Motivation
Watching movies could be motivational in many ways.
Giving your mind a break from work for something enjoyable could motivate you to be more productive when you get back to it and
to ward off feelings of burnout.
If the movie highlights someone successfully chasing their ambitions, it could motivate you to do the same. It might also inspire
you to take up a new hobby or pursue a new goal, according to a 2020 studyTrusted Source.
Improve relationships
If you've been feeling some level of disconnect between someone close to you - whether it's your romantic partner, best friend,
or child - watching movies together could be just the ticket to rekindle your relationship.
It could be especially helpful if you have the same taste in movies and choose something new that you're both enthused about watching.
Not only will you bond in the moment of watching, but you might feel a renewed sense of connection when you discuss what you watched afterward.
Reduce stress
A good comedy could help lower your stress levels. A 2016 study found that laughter could reduce the levels of hormones in the body
responsible for stress, such as cortisol and epinephrine.
If you're not in the mood to laugh, consider a drama or tearjerker. Crying could also lower cortisol levels in the blood, according
to a 2020 study.
Inspire social and cultural reflection
Watching films that take on tough topics could be a thought-provoking experience for you.
Whether you want to better understand a current social issue or spark a conversation about an opposing point of view, watching films
could help educate and enlighten.
What is cinema therapy?
Aside from providing entertainment and a distraction from a stressful day, watching movies could also be a therapy technique.
Cinema and video therapy are sometimes used as a part of psychotherapy. Therapists might use this type of therapy to expose you to a
character who might be having a similar emotional experience, according to a 2021 studyTrusted Source.
It could also encourage you to look at your situation from a different perspective, providing new ways of coping.
A therapist might choose a commercial film or video (documentary) related to your challenges. If you're having trouble in your
romantic relationship, you might be instructed to watch a film with the same theme.
You might also be given therapeutic exercises to perform before, during, or after viewing.
The movie, genre, and the theme chosen will depend on your situation.
Let's recap
Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as watching movies, can be beneficial. It could boost your mental health, relieve stress,
and foster relationships.
Still, movies aren't a treatment or cure for your mental health symptoms. If your symptoms interfere with your daily life, a mental
health professional could help.
They might be able to determine whether cinema therapy would work for you and your lifestyle.`

const article_climate =`First, why are we focusing on climate and agriculture?
The research is out there and it's clear that we need to act aggressively on the climate crisis. Some reports say that we only have
12 years to meaningfully address the climate crisis. It's also said that we have less than 60 years of agricultural topsoil left to
grow food. At the same time, our food system is a big part of the problem, emitting between one quarter and one third of the world's
greenhouse gases.
We know that we need to slow the pollution we're emitting, but there's already too much carbon dioxide in the air, so we also need a
way to drawdown carbon if we're going to slow the warming of our atmosphere.
The good news: research shows that agriculture and gardening are a great way to do both-pull carbon out of the air and slow emissions.
This intersection of food and climate is a place where we can exercise our decision-making power and engage in meaningful action, every
time we eat or work in the garden.
Green America is working with large farms and companies to do this as well, but change at the large scale takes time, which is why we're
asking gardeners to be trail blazers in their own backyards to get this idea out into the world ahead of the curve, before climate-positive
food is something that's widely available at the grocery store.
There's two ways to think about climate solutions in our gardens.
The first is maximizing soil protection within our gardens, because this is where we can capture carbon by pulling it out of the air
and storing it in plants and underground.
The second way is all about minimizing climate impacts beyond the boundaries of our gardens and making decisions that help reduce emissions.
For example, if you don't buy chemical fertilizers, you're reducing pollution and emissions that would have come from producing and
transporting that fertilizer from the factory to the store.
Climate Victory Gardening practices help gardeners make decisions that work towards these two goals.
How do plants and soils capture carbon?
This is something they do naturally, and it's up to gardeners to create the right conditions.
Plant grow using photosynthesis, a process in which they harness the sun's energy, water, and carbon dioxide to create food in the
form of sugars or carbohydrates (base word: carbon). This food helps plants grow and build cells, as well as feed life in the soil
that provides them with nutrients (through a symbiotic relationship, meaning they help each other out). The plants grow to produce
healthy food and release oxygen as a byproduct, which is what makes our plant habitable for life.
A single teaspoon of healthy soil has billions of microorganisms. This soil life includes everything from earthworms to beneficial
bacteria and fungi; these are the workhorses we're harnessing to pull carbon out of the air.
Today, industrial agriculture and conventional gardening methods treat soil badly, often with synthetic chemicals that harm life in
the soil, which then releases carbon into the air-turning farms and gardens into a source of carbon emissions. But, under good management,
soil and these microorganisms can hold huge amounts of carbon. We just have to grow food the right way.
Rethinking carbon
Carbon is something we often think of as bad, because we associate it with our changing climate. But, it's the basic building block
for all life. In the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, carbon creates a greenhouse effect that heats our planet, but plants use carbon
to create cells to grow and feed microorganisms in the soil that support them.
It's the carbon that goes into the soil through plants that has the biggest potential for change. Those billions of microorganisms?
They represent a quarter of Earth's biodiversity, and this is where we want to get the carbon, because it's more likely to stay
underground and it helps our gardens grow.
You don't have to be a scientist to know this; many gardeners are well acquainted with carbon in healthy soils, but might recognize
it as organic matter, the crumbly texture, or its rich, earthy smell. Soil health is integral both as a climate solution and a
successful garden.
When we grow food at home in a regenerative manner; we purchase less food that has traveled across the country, we keep methane-producing
organic materials out of landfills with composting, we increase the water holding capacity of our soil to decrease flooding and runoff,
and most importantly we rebuild our soil health bringing back its carbon sequestering potential.`

const article_plants = `Plants have developed the amazing ability to directly harness the energy from the sun,
an incredibly effective way of feeding themselves. All plant leaves are natural solar panels, far more efficient
than our own technology, developed over hundreds of millions of years. The conversion of light into energy takes
place within the green pigment in the leaf known as chlorophyll. Water is moved from the roots to the leaves
through the xylem tissues while carbon dioxide is collected by specialized cells on the undersides of leaves
called stomata. As a plant draws in air through the stomata it is losing water to transpiration.
At a certain temperature, water loss is so great that a plant will shut down photosynthesis in order to
avoid the water loss. This is a good reason to control air temperature in your garden.
The reaction of light energy and carbon dioxide within plants leaves creates simple sugars, carbohydrates,
for energy. The reaction involves 6 molecules of water and 6 molecules of carbon dioxide which combine with
solar energy to a molecule of glucose and 6 molecules of oxygen. This oxygen is released back into the air
which is good for us and is one of the reasons why plants are essential for our well being.
Plants use their sugar energy to grow and break down carbohydrates in the presence of oxygen within cells.
This process releases a certain amount of carbon dioxide and lots of usable energy. The buildup of carbon dioxide
is generally released into the environment at night. The energy created by this process is used to drive the
creation of starches, proteins, enzymes, growth regulators and DNA/RNA structures.
There are 16 essential elements for plant growth, some of which can be taken from the air or water, such as carbon,
oxygen and hydrogen. Even nitrogen can be taken from the air if the proper biology is active in the soil.
Other nutrients can be taken from the soil although generally a grower must supplement a wide variety of nutrients
to get plants growing well, especially in soilless and water based systems. This is because they lack the
mineralization found in true soil.
Plants require macro nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium and Sulphur. Micro
nutrients are also required but at much lower levels than the previous group. Iron, Copper, Boron, Zinc,
Manganese, Molybdenum and Chlorine benefit all plants. Ratios between nutrients are also very important.
Quality fertilizers will also look at balancing the nutrients carefully to avoid issues. Examples would be
calcium to magnesium and iron to sulphur ratios but there are many more.
Over supply and deficiencies are something all gardeners face. Research can help you determine individual
issues and solutions to your problems. Finding images of deficiencies through universities or other
online sources can provide valuable visual confirmation to assist you in your diagnosis. Deficiencies
and their nutrient causes can be mobile or immobile. In general if you see problems in older leaves
it relates to a mobile nutrient. Nitrogen deficiency is a great example of a mobile nutrient issue.
Those issues arising in new growth are usually related to immobile elements, such as the onset of a calcium deficiency.
Although some nutrients are considered essential others have shown tremendous value such as silicon,
deemed to be essential to some plants. Other elements such as cobalt seem to impact the way other
nutrients are used. Nickel is another example of an assisting nutrient. If a grower plans to use urea
nitrogen then the use of nickel is essential to getting the most from this nitrogen source.
Amino acids are an essential building block for plants and are born out of the photosynthesis reaction.
These molecules are protein based peptides and are catalysts for many reactions within plants.
Once formed amino acids can be used to perform very specific functions, for instance glutamic acid
allows for better assimilation of calcium through a complex chelation. Many amino acids are also
precursors to the formation of growth regulating substances within plants, a good example is tryptophan which assists
in the production of auxins. Some amino acids can increase efficiency of certain processes such as glycine and its
effect on chlorophyll concentration and corresponding acceleration of photosynthesis.
Amino acids can also play a role in stress relief during biotic and abiotic stresses such as temperature fluctuation
or pest pressure. This relief ensures plants can adjust and refocus energy towards efficient and productive growth.
Enzymes are the key to the breakdown of material on our planet. All living things secrete enzymes, including plants
and humans alike. Enzymes have specific decomposition abilities such as, cellulase which breaks down cellulose.
This breakdown of material provides for a recycling of nutrients within the natural world.`

const article_earthquake = `Stay Safe During an Earthquake
Know what to do to keep yourself and your loved ones safe during an earthquake. In most situations,
you can protect yourself if you immediately DROP, COVER, and HOLD ON.
Drop. Cover. Hold on.
In most situations, you can protect yourself if you immediately:
DROP down onto your hands and knees before the earthquake knocks you down. This position protects
you from falling but allows you to still move if necessary.
COVER your head and neck (and your entire body if possible) underneath a sturdy table or desk. If
there is no shelter nearby, get down near an interior wall or next to low-lying furniture that won't fall on you,
and cover your head and neck with your arms and hands.
HOLD ON to your shelter (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared to move with your shelter
if the shaking shifts it around.
If you are inside, stay inside.
DO NOT run outside or to other rooms during an earthquake. You are less likely to be injured if you stay where you are.
To reduce your chances of being hurt, take the following actions:
If possible, within the few seconds before shaking intensifies, quickly move away from glass, hanging objects,
bookcases, china cabinets, or other large furniture that could fall. Watch for falling objects, such as bricks from fireplaces and
chimneys, light fixtures, wall hangings, high shelves, and cabinets with doors that could swing open.
If available nearby, grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and broken glass.
If you are in the kitchen, quickly turn off the stove and take cover at the first sign of shaking.
If you are in bed, hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow. You are less likely to be injured staying where
you are. Broken glass on the floor can cause injuries if you walk or roll onto the floor.
DO NOT stand in a doorway. You are safer under a table. In modern houses, doorways are no stronger than any other part of the house. Doorways
do not protect you from the most likely source of injury − falling or flying objects. Most earthquake-related injuries and deaths are caused
by falling or flying objects (such as TVs, lamps, glass, or bookcases), or by being knocked to the ground.
If you are in a high-rise building, drop, cover, and hold on.
Be Ready! Earthquakes Infographic
Move away from windows and outside walls.
Stay in the building.
DO NOT use the elevators. The electricity may go out, and the sprinkler systems may come on.
If you are trapped, stay calm. Try to get someone's attention by tapping on hard or metal parts of the structure. Doing so may increase
your chances of being rescued.
If you are inside a crowded place, drop, cover, and hold on.
Do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea.
Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall.
If you can, take cover and grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and glass.
If you are outside, stay outside.
Move away from buildings, utility wires, sinkholes, and fuel and gas lines. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways
and close to outer walls of buildings.
Go to an open area away from trees, telephone poles, and buildings. Once in the open, get down low and stay there until the shaking stops.
The area near the outside walls of a building is the most dangerous place to be. Windows, facades, and architectural details are often the
first parts of the building to collapse. Stay away from this danger zone.
If you are in a moving vehicle, stop as quickly and safely as possible.
Move your car to the shoulder or curb, away from utility poles, overhead wires, and under- or overpasses.
Stay in the car and set the parking brake. A car may jiggle violently on its springs, but it is a good place to stay until the shaking stops.
Turn on the radio for emergency broadcast information.
If a power line falls on the car, stay inside until a trained person removes the wire.
When it is safe to begin driving again, watch for hazards created by the earthquake, such as breaks in the pavement, downed utility poles and
wires, rising water levels, fallen overpasses, or collapsed bridges.
If you are in a stadium or theater, stay in your seat. Protect your head and neck with your arms or any way possible.
Do not leave until the shaking is over.
Walk out carefully watching for anything that could fall during the aftershocks.
If you are near the shore, drop, cover, and hold on until the shaking stops.
If severe shaking lasts 20 seconds or more, immediately evacuate to high ground as a tsunami might have been generated by the earthquake.
Move inland 2 miles (3 kilometers) or to land that is at least 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level immediately. Don't wait for officials to
issue a warning.
Walk quickly, rather than drive, to avoid traffic, debris, and other hazards.
If you cannot drop to the ground, try to sit or remain seated so you are not knocked down.
If you are in a wheelchair, lock your wheels. Remove any items that are not securely attached to the wheelchair.
Protect your head and neck with a large book, a pillow, or your arms. The goal is to prevent injuries from falling down or from objects that
might fall or be thrown at you.
If you are able, seek shelter under a sturdy table or desk. Stay away from outer walls, windows, fireplaces, and hanging objects.
If you are unable to move from a bed or chair, protect yourself from falling objects by covering up with blankets and pillows.
If you are outside, go to an open area away from trees, telephone poles, and buildings, and stay there.

const article_mountEverest = `Mount Everest is the highest peak in the world which stands at 8848 m high altitude from sea level. Mount Everest named by name of Sir George Everest in 1865 AD.
It is located in the Solukhumbu district of Nepal. Mount Everest, known in Nepalese as Sagarmatha and in the Tibetan language they
are called as Chomolungma (Zhumulangma). There are other local names also provided for Mount Everest like Third pole, Peak xv, and
local sherpa's they called Deudhunga.
Everest is believed to be 60 million years old. Everest was formed by the movement of earth's tectonic plates, as the Indian subcontinental
plate collides with the Eurasian continental plate. No one knew that Mt Everest was the top of the world until the 19th century.
Mount Everest was first conquered by Sir Edmund Percival Hillary KG and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa on 29 May 1953 AD. Out of the 10
highest mountains, 8 of them are in Nepal. Among them, the most popular one is Mount Everest. People attempt to climb Mount Everest in 1920 AD.
Mount Everest mountaineering
A little less than 5000 climbers have tried to climb Mount Everest. 240 of them never came back. The fatality rate of Mount
Everest is 6.5%. Avalanche unexpected climate is the Main region of mountaineers failure to climb a high mountain.  Unexpected storms,
avalanches, freezing temperatures, high winds, crevasse and the dangers presented by the extreme high altitudes are extremely hard to
overcome even for the most experienced climbers. However, the use of advanced gear and technology made in modern time and the use of highly
trained guides help in decreasing the fatality rate.
Climbers, generally they spend their 6 month time to acclimatize their body with high altitude. At that time they will take training for an
expedition to Everest. That is compulsory for Everest summiter. Then pass through Everest Base Camp and then 4 additional camps in order to
allow their bodies to adopt to the high altitude. Getting one by one camp 1, camp 2, camp 3, receptively and finally, they will summit
Mt.everest.
Climbing Mount Everest is the dream of most people. But climbing in reality, you should be physically and mentally prepared. There are few
requirements to meet before climbing Mount Everest in Nepal. Climbers must be between 18 and 75 years of age. Permits will only be given
to those who can prove they have already scaled mountains that are higher than 6,500 meters (21,325 feet). Disabled or visually impaired
people need someone to carry them. Only those who can go on their own will be given permission.
Temperature
The weather conditions are extreme on Mount Everest. During the January month which is the coldest month of the year, the temperature reaches
low to -76 ℉(-60℃). The temperatures are registered at 19℉ (-7℃). The temperature never rises above freezing. It was always very hard to
predict the weather of Mount Everest. In addition to the dangerously cold temperatures, the wind and carelessness also present danger to
climbers. High winds often carry sand and bits of stone, in addition to snow and ice during storms. Even unexpected storms have been known
to bring as much as 10 feet(3m) of snow.
Best season for climbing(Summit) Everest.
The best time for climbing Mount Everest in April to May and from mid-June to August. Summer may not be the best time to climb Everest but
you can still climb as per your choice. To summit Mt.Everest you should follow some rules of government of Nepal. By the government of Nepal
fixed a date to summit Everest base camp for some days. There is not allowed to climb Mt.everest any time. Most of the time fixed in the April
to May due to the favorable season. You have to fulfill some legal documents before climbing for the Government of Nepal.
Best Season For Everest region trekking.
Trekking to the Everest base camp is one of the popular trekking of Nepal. Most of the people, they want to visit overview Mt.Everest from
the close-up view. They will visit the Everest base camp(5364m) and Kala Patthar(5545m). Kala Patthar(5545m) Which is the most popular viewpoint
of the Everest base camp. The best season for the trek to Everest region will be September to mid of December and February to June.
That's called the high season. That is a little bit busy season of the mountain. Due to that time weather will be the clear and cloudless
sky in the mountain. Then you will see an attractive overview of the mountain.
Some of the group also found in the January and July August season there is some difficult situation. In January there will be cold and
snowing in the way of trekking but mountain view will be very beautiful. Mountain will be fully covered by snow. During the daytime temperature
is best but at night there will be freezing cold. During the July, August that will be the raining season of Nepal. So the weather is
changeable and heavy rainfall during this time.
Most popular peak climbing of the Everest region:
The most important thing to who want to summit Mt.Everest. First, they must be climbed over then 6500 m high peak. And then they will be

const article_graphicsCard =`A graphics card's job is complex, but its principles and components are easy to understand. In this article, we
will look at the basic parts of a video card and what they do. We'll also examine the factors that work together to make a fast,
efficient graphics card.
Think of a computer as a company with its own art department. When people in the company want a piece of artwork, they send a
request to the art department. The art department decides how to create the image and then puts it on paper. The end result is
that someone's idea becomes an actual, viewable picture.
A graphics card works along the same principles. The CPU, working in conjunction with software applications, sends information
about the image to the graphics card. The graphics card decides how to use the pixels on the screen to create the image. It then
sends that information to the monitor through a cable.
Creating an image out of binary data is a demanding process. To make a 3-D image, the graphics card first creates a wire frame out of
straight lines. Then, it rasterizes the image (fills in the remaining pixels). It also adds lighting, texture and color. For fast-paced
games, the computer has to go through this process about 60 to 120 times per second. Without a graphics card to perform the necessary
calculations, the workload would be too much for the computer to handle.
The graphics card accomplishes this task using four main components:
A motherboard connection for data and power
A graphics processor (GPU) to decide what to do with each pixel on the screen
Video memory (VRAM) to hold information about each pixel and to temporarily store completed pictures
A monitor connection so you can see the final result
Next, we'll look at the processor and memory in more detail.
Like a motherboard, a graphics card is a printed circuit board that houses a processor and VRAM. It also has an input/output system (BIOS)
chip that stores the card's settings and performs diagnostics on the memory, input and output at startup.
A graphics card's processor, called a graphics processing unit (GPU), is similar to a computer's CPU. A GPU, however, is designed specifically
for performing the complex mathematical and geometric calculations that are necessary for graphics rendering. Some of the fastest GPUs have
more transistors than the average CPU.
A GPU produces a lot of heat, so it is usually located under a heat sink or a fan. Integrated chips differ slightly, in that they don't have
their own VRAM, and have to pull from the same RAM stockpile as the CPU. This distinction may cause your system to run short on memory while
gaming with an integrated GPU.
In addition to its processing power, a GPU uses special programming to help it analyze and use data. AMD and Nvidia (see Nvidia coupons)
produce the vast majority of GPUs on the market, and both companies have developed their own enhancements for GPU performance. Today's video
processors can provide:
Full scene anti-aliasing (FSAA), which smooths the edges of 3-D objects
Anisotropic filtering (AF), which makes images look crisper
Real-time physics and particle effects
Multiscreen displays
High frame rate video output
Ultra high-definition video with many millions of pixels
GPU-accelerated calculations
Each company has also developed specific techniques to help the GPU apply colors, shading, textures and patterns.
As the GPU creates images, it needs somewhere to hold information and completed pictures. It uses the card's RAM for this purpose, storing
data about each pixel, its color and its location on the screen. Part of the VRAM can also act as a frame buffer, meaning that it holds
completed images until it is time to display them. Typically, video RAM operates at very high speeds and is dual ported, meaning that the
system can read from it and write to it at the same time.
Modern video cards plug into a PCIe x16 expansion slot. Small form-factor computers with integrated graphics, such as laptops and mini
desktops, may not come with such a slot. Graphics cards can still be connected, however, using a costly workaround device called an external GPU.
Choosing a Good Graphics Card
A top-of-the-line graphics card is easy to spot. It has lots of memory and a fast processor. Often, it's also more visually appealing than
anything else that's intended to go inside a computer's case. Lots of high-performance video cards are illustrated or have decorative fans
or heat sinks.
But a high-end card provides more power than most people really need. People who use their computers primarily for email, word processing
or social media can find all the necessary graphics support on a CPU with integrated graphics. A mid-range card is sufficient for most
casual gamers. People who need the power of a high-end card include gaming enthusiasts and people who do lots of 3-D graphic work.
A good overall measurement of a card's performance is its frame rate, measured in frames per second (FPS). The frame rate describes how
many complete images the card can display per second. The human eye can process about 25 frames every second, but fast-action games require
a frame rate of at least 60 FPS to provide smooth animation and scrolling. Components of the frame rate are:
Triangles or vertices per second: 3-D images are made of triangles or polygons. This measurement describes how quickly the GPU can
calculate the whole polygon or the vertices that define it. In general, it describes how quickly the card builds a wire frame image.
Pixel fill rate: This measurement describes how many pixels the GPU can process in a second, which translates to how quickly it can
rasterize the image.
The graphics card's hardware directly affects its speed. These are the hardware specifications that most affect the card's speed and the
units in which they are measured:
GPU clock speed (MHz)
Size of the memory bus (bits)
Amount of available memory (MB)
Memory clock rate (MHz)
Memory bandwidth (GB/s)
The computer's CPU and motherboard also play a part, since a very fast graphics card can't compensate for a motherboard's inability to deliver
data quickly. Similarly, the card's connection to the motherboard and the speed at which it can get instructions from the CPU affect its performance.`

const article_blueScreenOfDeath=`What is the blue screen of death (BSOD)?
Officially called the stop screen, or stop error, the blue screen of death (BSOD) is a most unwanted error, second only to malware or
ransomware in indicating that a user is in for a very bad day. It comes with no warning and all unsaved work is immediately lost.
And given what it indicates, that could be the least of a user's problems.
BSODs result from a driver software error or issues with hardware. A BSOD is a full system failure at the Windows kernel level due to
an issue with Windows drivers and/or hardware. It is not an app crash. If the browser crashes, Windows continues running. It's very rare
that an app can cause a blue screen because they run at a higher level in the operating system.
The term blue screen of death stems from the fact that a blue screen with white text appears describing the error when it occurs. Up to
Windows 7, the BSOD was full of hardware information that was useless to most users.
Starting with Windows 8, it scaled down the amount of information and put a large sad face on the screen. It also puts a QR code on screen
so users can look up the cause of the blue screen with their smartphones.
When hit with a BSOD, a computer stops running for its own protection to prevent a catastrophic hardware failure or damage to devices, while
creating a memory dump file and writing it to disk. Users then must reset their systems to restart Windows.
When a computer restarts after receiving a BSOD, it goes through an automatic troubleshooting and repair process. However, if Windows can't
repair the issue, users can try to troubleshoot on their own.
What causes BSOD?
There are two causes for the BSOD: hardware and software. At the software level, it would most likely be software drivers for hardware devices.
A bad device driver can easily cause a BSOD. It is far less likely that an app such as Microsoft Word would cause one, but not impossible.
If a BSOD occurs after a device driver upgrade, then the solution is to roll back or uninstall the driver -- or perhaps reinstall it -- as the
initial install could have been corrupted.
There could also be a very low-level bug in the firmware or BIOS. In this case, users should check with the motherboard maker for a BIOS upgrade.
If the issue is with a hardware component such as a graphics card or sound board, the easiest way to check is to remove the board and see if
the problem persists. For more vital components such as SSDs (solid-state drives) and memory, there are utilities to run diagnostics.
Most SSD makers have free utilities to test their hardware, while the free utility MemTest86 is the standard for memory testing. Less frequent
causes for a BSOD are low disk space and malware. If a computer is very low on space on the C: drive, the Windows swap or paging file might
have problems. Malware can cause issues if the infection causes damage to the hard disk master boot record or system files are damaged.
Troubleshooting BSOD
During a BSOD, stop codes appear at the bottom of the screen. There are 270 stop codes total, but most are exceptionally rare. Here are the most common:
KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED
An error in the kernel process associated with incompatibility or equipment malfunction.
NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM
This is a drive error caused during read or write, usually due to data integrity on disk or in memory.
DATA_BUS_ERROR
This is the result of errors in RAM. The cause may be incompatible or defective memory sticks.
IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
This error may be due to a malfunction of the drivers, system services or incompatible software.
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA
This is an error related to the swap file during operation of file systems or failure of a service or software.
Troubleshooting BSOD
Here are some steps to take to troubleshoot BSOD:
When a BSOD appears, users should write down the error code and reboot their computer. Windows will attempt to determine the problem and fix it.
In many instances, that's enough to address the problem.
If the problem persists, users should think back to what they did before the BSOD occurred. Was a new program installed, driver updated,
or new app installed or upgraded? If so, that may be what caused the BSOD.
If it comes out of nowhere and no recent software changes were made -- that includes Patch Tuesday fixes, which have introduced a fair share
of BSODs after an update -- then it might be hardware failure.
If the error persists after a user installs a new program/hardware, updates a driver or installs a Windows update, consider a system rollback.
Windows has a feature called System Restore, which takes a snapshot of a computer, OS and apps, saving it for emergencies such as this.
Keep in mind, System Restore defaults to off, so users must turn it on. It can be found in the system utilities.
A virus check for a persistent BSOD is a good idea. Users should restart their computers in safe mode by hitting F5 at boot for the menu
option and run their antivirus software. An even better option is to have a USB drive with a preinstalled antivirus to boot from rather
than the computer. However, users must plan ahead to make such a USB drive.
An incorrectly installed or outdated driver can lead to a system crash. Users should download and install the latest drivers for their
computer's hardware from the computer manufacturer's website. This may fix BSOD caused by driver problems.
Removing computer components such as memory sticks and cards may also determine the cause of a problem.
If all else fails, users can try resetting Windows or performing a clean install. However, this is a last-resort option and users should
be sure to back up all important data to an external hard drive before reinstalling Windows.`

const article_bios=`What is BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)?
Right after a computer is turned on, it is important to make sure that there are no issues with hardware that could potentially compromise
the computer's functionality.
In this blog, you'll learn more about what BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is and why it is an integral part of the booting process to
ensure effective, secure operation.
What is BIOS?
BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is software stored on a small memory chip (firmware) on the motherboard, and it is the very
first software to run after a computer starts.
The BIOS instructs the computer on how to perform basic functions such as booting and keyboard control. The BIOS is also used to
identify and configure the hardware in a computer such as the hard drive, floppy disk, optical drive, CPU, memory, and related equipment.
Finally, it manages data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and attached devices.
BIOS firmware is non-volatile, meaning that its settings are saved and recoverable even after power has been removed from the device.
Why is BIOS important?
In essence, the BIOS identifies, configures, tests, and connects computer hardware to the OS after a computer is turned on.
(This is called the boot process.)
The BIOS is responsible for POST, or Power-on Self-Test, the initial set of diagnostic tests performed by the computer right
after it is powered on, with the intent to check for any hardware related issues.
POST is the first step of the boot sequence, and it is always going to run regardless of whether you've just restarted your
computer or you're turning it on for the first time in days.
POST does not rely on any specific operating system. In fact, there does not even need to be an OS installed on a hard drive
for it to run. This is because POST is handled by the BIOS, not any installed software. If an OS is installed, POST runs before
it has a chance to start up.
POST checks that basic system devices are present and working properly, like the keyboard and other peripheral devices, and other
hardware elements like the processors, storage devices, and memory.
The computer will continue to boot after POST, but only if POST is successful. If POST finds an issue, you will get an error of
some kind, and hopefully, it is clear enough for you to jump-start the troubleshooting process.
How to access BIOS
The BIOS is accessed and configured through the BIOS Setup Utility. The BIOS Setup Utility is, in essence, the BIOS itself.
All available options in BIOS are configurable through the BIOS Setup Utility.
Unlike an operating system, BIOS comes installed from the moment a system is manufactured.
The BIOS Setup Utility can be accessed in various ways depending on the computer or motherboard make and model.
What contains BIOS?
All modern computer motherboards contain BIOS software.
BIOS access and configuration are independent of any operating system because the BIOS is part of the motherboard hardware.
Irrespective of whether or not an operating system is installed, the BIOS functions outside of the operating system environment.
BIOS Manufacturers
Some of the most popular BIOS vendors are:
1.	Pheonix Technologies
2.	IBM
3.	Dell
4.	American Megatrends (AMI)
5.	Insyde Software
How to use BIOS
BIOS supports several hardware configuration options the can be changed through the setup utility. Saving these changes and
restarting the computer applies the changes to the BIOS and alters the way BIOS instructs the hardware to function.
Here are some common things you can do in most BIOS systems:
Change the Boot Order
Load BIOS Setup Defaults

BIOS Security
Cyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated, and traditional safeguards are proving to be ineffective in the face of these
advanced attacks.
Without BIOS security, hackers can easily access and manipulate a computer's information, gaining control over your system up to the
highest level.
These data breaches are often very difficult to detect, even when using high-level scanning and other protective measures.
There are three primary methods used to protect your BIOS: passwords, full-disk encryption, and trusted platform modules.

const article_computerCables = `In the computer system, there are several different parts which are connected to the system.
These parts can be directly plugged into the computer system computer motherboard, or there can be a requirement of some cable
to connect computer parts to the system. These parts can be digital cameras, hard drives, mice or other devices. There are different
types of cables in the market, like HDMI cable, VGA cable, DVI cable, Ethernet cable, PS/2 cable, 3.5 mm audio cable, USB cable, and
computer power cord cable.
1. HDMI cable
HDMI (High definition Media Interface) is a type of computer cable used to transmit high definition video and audio signals. Using the
HDMI cables, the audio and video signal can be easily transmitted without compromising the quality of images and can send crystal clear
images using this cable. The HDMI cables are used to connect cable boxes, TVs, DVD players, media streamers and other electronic devices.
All types of Av devices can be connected to one standard cable, which is an HDMI cable. Also, one HDMI cable is capable of transmitting
both audio and video signals at the same time.
2. VGA cable
VGA (Video Graphics Ray) cable is another type of computer cable which is used for sending video signals and is used to link the monitor
and the CPU of a computer. The VGA cable can also be used in HD televisions. All the information displayed on the monitor is coming from
the VGA cable. There is a total of 15 pins in the plugin the cable, which have three rows containing 5 pins each. And the cable is easily
fitted in the monitor and the other end is fixed in the CPU of a computer system.
3. DVI cable
DVI cables are used to connect the LCD monitor and the video card. Using this cable, the user can see high image quality without having any
disturbance. The DVI cable is mostly used in CRT monitors, which have a VGA connection. This cable transmits the digital and analog signals
to the computer system. The DVI cable is capable enough of digital connections and analog connections. The DVI cable can be easily
distinguished, whether it is analog or digital, by looking if there is any flat pin present on the cable. If the flat pin has four pins
around, then it is a DVI analog, and there is only a flat pin, then it is DVI digital.
4. Ethernet Cable
The Ethernet cable is a type of computer network cable which is used for a wired network. The Ethernet cable is used to connect the switches,
monitors, PCs to the LAN (Local Area Network). The length and durability of the Ethernet cable describe the quality of the connection.
If the cable is too long and is not durable, it will contain a poor quality of the signal. And due to this factor, there are different
types of Ethernet cables present in the market. The Ethernet cables are plugged into the Ethernet port present on the motherboard.
The Ethernet cable looks like a phone cable but contains more wires than phone cables. There are eight wires in the Ethernet cable,
and they can be available in different colors in the market.
5. PS/2 Cable
The PS/2 cable is a standard cable to connect the mouse and keyboard to the computer system. The length of the PS/2 cable is long enough
so that the user can easily connect the mouse and keyboard to the system and use the system. There are a total of 6 pins in PS/2 cables
and have a round connector. There are majorly two sizes of PS/2 cable. The smaller size is the most common cable, but some adaptors can be
used to convert it into a larger size. This cable is now replaced with USB cables as they are universal cables and can be easily plugged
into any system.
6. 5mm Audio Cable
The 3.5mm audio cables are a type of computer cables that are used in computer audio applications. This cable can be used for connecting a
mini-stereo audio device, PC sound card or any portable CD player to any multimedia speaker. This cable can also be used to connect earphones
and headphones to the system.
The green port is for headphones and computer speakers. Blue port is for DVD player, MP3 player and pink port Is used for connecting
microphones.
7. USB cables
The USB (Universal Serial Bus) cable is a standard cable used to connect universal devices or personal computers. It is mainly used for
short-distance digital communication. The digital data can be transferred using a USB cable. Nowadays, the USB cable is used to charge devices
like smartphones, Bluetooth speakers, trimmers and many more. The USB cables can be used to connect two devices directly. The USB cable is
connected to the USB port present in the computer system. The mouse and keyboard are also connected to a USB port as they have USB cables.
As the device is connected through the USB cable, the unplugging of the USB cable when a device is running can cause damage to a device,
so whenever there is a need of removing the USB cable, first it should be eject safely and then it should be removed from the system.
Advantages of Computer Cables
Below are some advantages explained below.
The computer cables can be used to connect various devices to the system and perform several operations. The computer cables can easily
transmit the digital and analog signal through it. Some of the computer cables are capable enough to transmit electric power through it like a
USB cable. Using a computer cable, one can see movies, play games, listen to music, and do many more things. Ethernet cables can be used to
connect the computer system to the internet world.
Conclusion
Every type of computer cable has its advantages and can be used for a different purpose. And all the computer cables are standard cables
which means they can be used to connect it to any system. The cable's performance depends on the size of the cable and the durability of the
cable.`

const article_precipitation =`What is Precipitation?
The falling of water from the sky in various forms is known as precipitation.
They're all formed by clouds in the troposphere, which are around 8 to 16 kilometers (4 to 11 miles) above the ground.
Precipitation happens when any form of water particle falls from the upper atmosphere to the earth's surface. Frictional drag and gravity
induce the drop to the ground. When a particle falls from the cloud, it creates a turbulent wake behind it, promoting faster and more frequent drops.
Depending on the atmospheric conditions, the crystallized ice may reach the ground as ice pellets or snow, or it may melt and convert into
raindrops before reaching the earth's surface.
Rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, hail, snow grains, and diamond dust are all examples of diverse types of precipitation. They are several
types of water that fall from the frozen clouds in the sky.
Process, Forms, and Types
Process: Condensation of water vapors in the air mass causes precipitation.
Due to adiabatic cooling, the rising air mass containing a significant number of water vapors becomes saturated.
Condensation of water vapors causes clouds to develop. In every cloud, there are updrafts and downdrafts.
The updraft determines cloud growth and height. The stronger the updraft, the taller the cloud. As the liquid water accumulates, the updraft
weakens and the downdraft strengthens. Thereafter, Precipitation results.
While all clouds contain water, only some generate precipitation. Precipitated moisture from clouds sometimes evaporates before reaching the
earth's surface. Precipitation happens when cloud droplets or ice crystals grow large enough to overcome atmospheric updrafts. It signifies
that specific processes are at work in a cloud that produces rain.
These mechanisms can be explained by two processes:
1. Bergeron Process
The clouds contain ice crystals and super-cooled water droplets. When an ice crystal collides with super-cooled water, it freezes the water.
This method uses two properties of water.
First property- A cloud's water droplets do not freeze at 0°C but remain liquid until -40°C termed as Super-cooled water If disturbed, super-cooled water will freeze.
It needs nuclei to freeze on. But freezing nuclei are rare in the atmosphere.
Hence, with an increase in temperature, some water droplets will turn into ice. Encouraging the formation of all-ice clouds, a single ice
crystal is added to a supercooled water droplet cloud.
Second property- Over ice crystals, the saturation vapor pressure (es) is lower than over water. Between water and ice crystals, a vapor
pressure gradient is created. Ice crystals are formed at the expense of supercooled water. When these ice crystals get large enough, they
begin to tumble out of the cloud. These ice crystals melt and fall as rain before reaching the ground.
2. Collision - Coalescence Process
This method is suited to clouds whose base does not exceed the freezing point.
Warm clouds are these. These clouds have several various-sized cloud droplets.
Large drops expand at the expense of smaller ones. So they crash with the smaller droplets and form part of it.
Updrafts and downdrafts repeatedly lift and lower cloud droplets in a huge cloud. So these drops grow swiftly. Raindrops must have a diameter of at least 100µ.
Cloud droplets collide to generate the size of a drizzle droplet. More collisions produce larger drops and rain. Small droplets of uniform size
may be present in clouds that do not produce precipitation. A condition like this could lead to colloidal stability in the clouds.
Because of the small size of the droplets, a collision may not occur and these cloud droplets can fall slowly and uniformly without colliding.
As a result, any clouds that lack the required size of cloud droplets may fail to produce precipitation.
Forms: The different forms of precipitation are as follows:
1. Rain
Rain is a form of precipitation that is in the form of water drops of a size that is larger than 0.5mm. The maximum raindrop size is about 6mm.
Drops of larger size break up into smaller drops as it falls down on the Earth's surface.
Rainfall is the predominant form of precipitation and therefore, the term precipitation is used synonymously with rainfall. The magnitude of
the rainfall shows high temporal and spatial variation. This variation causes the occurrence of hydrologic extremes like floods and droughts.
2. Snow
Snow consists of ice crystals in a flaky form, having an average density of 0.1g/cc. It is also an important form of precipitation that usually
forms in colder climates and higher altitudes.
3. Drizzle
Drizzle is a fine sprinkle of tiny water droplets that have a size less than 0.5mm and an intensity greater than 1mm/h. The tiny drops that
form a drizzle appear floating in the air.
4. Glaze or Freezing Rain
The glaze is formed when rain or drizzle comes in direct contact with the cold ground at around 0 degrees celsius. This water drops freeze
to form an ice coating known as glaze.
5. Sleet
Sleet is frozen raindrops that are formed when rainfall passes through the air in the atmosphere at subfreezing temperatures.
6. Hail
Hail is a kind of showery precipitation in the form of pellets or lumps that have a size greater than 8mm. Hail occurs during violent
thunderstorms. These are examples of precipitation. Let us now look at what are the different types of precipitation.
7. Sun shower
A sun shower occurs when rain falls while the sun shines.
In the absence of clouds, raindrops fall from the sky when rain-bearing winds blow several miles away.
As a result, a sun shower occurs when a single rain cloud crosses the earth's surface, allowing the sun's rays to flow through. It is usually
accompanied by a rainbow.
8. Grains of Snow
Snow grains are tiny white ice grains. Snow grains are flat, with a diameter of about 1mm. They are almost as big as a drizzle.
9. Diamond Dust
Diamond dust is made up of tiny ice crystals that occur at low altitudes and temperatures. The dazzling effect caused by light reflecting off
ice crystals in the air gave diamond dust its name.
10. Ice Crystal
This is a common occurrence in colder regions of the globe. The crystals resemble fog, with water particles freezing into ice. Ice crystals
look similar to needles, plates, or columns in shape.
11. Virga
Virga looks like a strip of rain that comes down from the cloud's base and evaporates before it reaches the ground. Dry or warm air is in the
way when rain falls through it.
Types of Precipitation: Precipitation occurs when the moist air mass undergoes the process of condensation. This process occurs when the air
is cooled and saturated with the same moisture amount. This process of cooling the air mass occurs only when the air mass moves up to the
higher altitudes. The air mass can be lifted to higher altitudes primarily by three methods based on which there are three different types of
precipitation which are as follows:
-Cyclonic Precipitation
-Convective Precipitation
-Orographic Precipitation
1. Cyclonic Precipitation
A cyclone is a region in the atmosphere that has a large low pressure having circular wind motion. The cyclonic precipitation is caused due
to the movement of moist air mass to this region by the difference in pressure. Cyclonic precipitation is two types: frontal and non-frontal precipitation.
-Frontal Precipitation
A frontal is known as the hot moist air mass boundary. This precipitation is caused due to the expansion of air near the frontal surface.
-Non-Frontal Precipitation
This is a cold moist air mass boundary that moves and results in precipitation.
2. Convective Precipitation
The air above the land area gets heated up due to some cause. Most of this warmer air rises up, cools, and precipitates. Convective
precipitation is showery by nature. This type of precipitation occurs in varying intensities.
3. Orographic Precipitation
Moving air masses have a chance to strike barriers such as mountains. Once they strike, they rise up causing condensation and precipitation.
The precipitation that occurs is greater on the windward side of the barrier when compared to the leeward side of the barrier.`

const article_solarEnergy = `What Is Solar Energy?
Solar energy uses the sun's light and heat to generate renewable or 'green' power. The most common form of solar energy is harnessed by
solar panels, or photovoltaic cells. In photovoltaic power stations, they're arranged almost edge-to-edge to capture sunlight in large fields.
You'll also see them on top of houses and other buildings at times, as well. The cells are created from semiconductor materials. When the sun's rays hit the cells, it loosens electrons from their atoms. This allows the electrons to flow through the cell and generate electricity.
On a much larger scale, solar collectors can generate power for thousands of people at once. Solar-thermal power plants use a variety of
techniques to produce power using the sun. The sun's energy is used to boil water which, in turn, operates a steam turbine to generate in a
similar fashion to that of coal or nuclear power plants.
Solar Energy Pros and Cons
Solar energy has pros and cons. It's important to find an energy that works for you, and determining if solar energy will fit into your daily
lifestyle is a priority. Here are some factors to consider when deciding which energy choice is right for you.
Advantages
The advantages of powering your home with solar energy are many, but we've narrowed the list down to the most important. Here are some
advantages to switching your home or business to solar power.
Lowers Your Electricity Bill
Reducing the monthly electric bill is a priority in most homes, and generating your own energy through the power of the sun is a simple way
to reduce your electric bill.
Not only does solar power save money, but it can help you earn more. Some solar energy systems are candidates for state-level incentives,
rebates, and federal tax credits. In order to qualify, the system must be certified by the Solar Rating and Certification Corporation (SRCC)
or a similar service endorsed by your state government. Because you're choosing a safer, greener electricity option, the government will
reward you with a tax cut helping you save money on installation.
Environmentally Friendly
Solar energy has far fewer carbon emissions than the standard forms of non-green energy that heavily rely on fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas
emissions are insignificant because solar power uses no fuel combustion. Each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of solar energy substantially reduces
greenhouse gas emissions like CO2 and other dangerous pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. The more
people who choose renewable energy, the cleaner our air will be.
Moves Us Towards Energy Independence
Limited resources like fossil fuels will one day run out and cannot be replaced, but the sun will keep on shining for another 5 billion years
or so. Remaining independent will allow our renewable resources to grow as technology further develops and we find more ways to incorporate
renewable energy into everyday life.
Sustainable
Solar energy could be a stable resource for billions of years. It's the most abundant energy resource on earth-173,000 terawatts of solar
energy strikes the Earth continuously. That's more than 10,000 times the world's total energy use.
Low Maintenance
Most solar energy systems come with a very extended warranty-sometimes up to 25 years. Maintenance usually only requires an annual cleaning,
and the solar PV and solar thermal parts will need to be changed out about every 10 years. There are no moving parts, so there's less that
could break down or go wrong. Since solar energy systems are easy to maintain, you won't have to spend too many repairs. This also makes solar
energy systems an attractive choice for people who might not be able to fix or maintain household appliances.
Benefits the Electricity Grid
Because solar power puts less burden on the electric grid, some U.S. states offer net metering policies. Net metering policies allow those who
generate solar power to sell excess electricity to a utility at a retail rate and receive credit on their utility bill. This credit offsets
the customer's electricity consumption during other times of the day or year, which reduces the amount of electricity you need to source
(and pay for) from a utility.
Disadvantages
Although there are many reasons to make the switch to an eco-friendly, renewable energy option, solar energy isn't the best for everyone.
Substantial Initial Investment
The initial installation of a solar power system can be quite costly upfront. Every company offers different pricing options. Cost can vary
depending on your location, number of solar panels needed, installation requirements, and labor fees. This can be difficult for some
households, and getting a loan or accruing credit card debt might be the only option for the purchase.
Doesn't Work at Night
Solar energy relies on utility grids to generate power at night when the sun isn't out. Some solar panel systems have an optional battery
backup but not all are available with this option. So when the sun isn't out, you'll have to rely on the energy grid like everyone else.
Energy Storage
If you don't use your solar energy immediately, it will have to be stored on batteries, which can be both costly and space consuming. These
batteries charge during the day so that you have energy to use at night.
Space Constraints
The more electricity you need, the more solar panels you will need, which leads to more space that you will have to use. Not all roofs have
adequate space to equip the number of solar panels that customers want or require. Solar panels can also be stored in your yard, but it needs
access to an abundant amount of sunlight, so yards with trees won't suffice.
Location Matters
Although the sun is an abundant source of energy, its intensity and availability can vary throughout the world. Depending on where you live,
your weather conditions might be rainier and cloudier than other places. In some parts of the world, like Alaska, the sun won't appear for
days in the wintertime, which can be an issue for those relying on solar energy sources.
Solar eclipses can also have an impact on solar energy generators. During an eclipse, those with solar systems will need to get power from
other sources of electricity to supplement the decrease in solar power.
If you live in an area with low sunlight, planning is everything. Have adequate battery backups to get you through the darker times.`

const article_vitaminC = `Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a nutrient your body needs to form blood vessels, cartilage, muscle and collagen
in bones. Vitamin C is also vital to your body's healing process.
Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps protect your cells against the effects of free radicals - molecules produced when your body
breaks down food or is exposed to tobacco smoke and radiation from the sun, X-rays or other sources. Free radicals might play a role in
heart disease, cancer and other diseases. Vitamin C also helps your body absorb and store iron.
Because your body doesn't produce vitamin C, you need to get it from your diet. Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, berries, potatoes,
tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli and spinach. Vitamin C is also available as an oral supplement, typically in the
form of capsules and chewable tablets.
Most people get enough vitamin C from a healthy diet. Vitamin C deficiency is more likely in people who:
-Smoke or are exposed to secondhand smoking
-Have certain gastrointestinal conditions or certain types of cancer
-Have a limited diet that doesn't regularly include fruits and vegetables
Severe vitamin C deficiency can lead to a disease called scurvy, which causes anemia, bleeding gums, bruising and poor wound healing.
If you take vitamin C for its antioxidant properties, keep in mind that the supplement might not offer the same benefits as naturally
occurring antioxidants in food.
The recommended daily amount of vitamin C is 90 milligrams for adult men and 75 milligrams for adult women.
Evidence
Research on the use of vitamin C for specific conditions shows:
-Cancer. Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables might lower your risk of many types of cancer, such as breast, colon and lung cancers.
However, it's not clear whether this protective effect is related to the vitamin C content in the food. Taking oral vitamin C supplements
doesn't appear to offer the same benefit.
-Common cold. Taking oral vitamin C supplements won't prevent the common cold. Evidence also shows that the benefits of regularly taking
vitamin C supplements to reduce the duration or severity of a cold are minimal.
-Eye diseases. Taking oral vitamin C supplements in combination with other vitamins and minerals seems to prevent age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) from worsening. Some studies also suggest that people who have higher levels of vitamin C in their diets have a lower
risk of developing cataracts.
Our take
Generally safe
Most people get enough vitamin C from a balanced diet. People who might be susceptible to vitamin C deficiency may benefit from the use of
vitamin C supplements.
Safety and side effects
When taken at appropriate doses, oral vitamin C supplements are generally considered safe. Taking too much vitamin C can cause side effects,
including:
-Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
-Heartburn
-Stomach cramps or bloating
-Fatigue and sleepiness, or sometimes insomnia
-Headache
-Skin flushing
In some people, oral vitamin C supplements can cause kidney stones, especially when taken in high doses. Long-term use of oral vitamin C
supplements over 2,000 milligrams a day increases the risk of significant side effects.
Tell your doctor that you're taking vitamin C supplements before having any medical tests. High levels of vitamin C might interfere with the
results of certain tests, such as stool tests for occult blood or glucose screening tests.
Interactions
Possible interactions include:
-Aluminum. Taking vitamin C can increase your absorption of aluminum from medications containing aluminum, such as phosphate binders.
This can be harmful for people with kidney problems.
-Chemotherapy. There is concern that use of antioxidants, such as vitamin C, during chemotherapy might reduce the effect of chemotherapy drugs.
-Estrogen. Taking vitamin C with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy might increase your estrogen levels.
-Protease inhibitors. Oral use of vitamin C might reduce the effect of these antiviral drugs.
-Statins and niacin. When taken with vitamin C, the effects of niacin and statins, which might benefit people with high cholesterol, could be reduced.
-Warfarin (Jantoven). High doses of vitamin C might reduce your response to this anticoagulant.`

- select a professional font for your resume, such as Arial or Helvetica
- adjust your font size between 10 and 12 points
This formatting is the default in Microsoft Word, so you shouldn't need to adjust anything if you're starting with a new document.
Adding style to your resume
After formatting your resume, you need to land on a style.
Your resume's style includes all the aesthetic details like:
- the colors of your resume
- the font you pick
- whether or not you use a sidebar
- how you set up your headers
For formal industries like law, finance, or politics, you should stick to a simple, traditional resume style. Clean lines, no graphics,
and dark colors like navy blue or burgundy are most appropriate.
However, if you want a job in a more creative industry like tech or marketing, you should use a more modern resume design. Modern resume
designs include brighter colors, sans-serif fonts, and graphic details like visual skill levels or sidebars.
2. Pick a resume layout
There are three main resume formats most job seekers use today. Each format is structured to help you lay out and emphasize different parts
of your professional background.
Those three formats include the chronological resume, the combination resume, and the functional resume.
The right format for you depends on your work history, the job you're applying to, and your skillset.
Chronological format
Most job seekers use the chronological resume format. This format is probably the best choice for you if you're just starting your career,
or have a consistent work history within a single industry and have no long employment gaps.
Chronological resumes place your work experience as the primary focus of your resume, and list each job according to when you held it
(with your most recent position at the top).
Hiring managers want to be able to see how your career has progressed over time, and the chronological format communicates that information
quickly and clearly.
Functional format
A functional resume (or "skills-based" resume) focuses on your relevant skills rather than each job you've held.
Instead of listing your work history, the functional resume format lists several broad skill categories. Bullet points under each category
provide supporting examples that illustrate you actually have those skills.
Functional resumes are ideal if you want to draw attention away from your work history. This format is useful if you have large employment
gaps or are writing a resume for a career change.
As its name suggests, the combination resume format (otherwise known as a hybrid resume) mixes the most significant features of both a
chronological and functional resume.
Combination resumes include a long skills section with categories, similar to a functional resume. They also have a detailed chronological
work experience section.
You may think all of these skills and experiences are a lot to fit on the page - and they are. Combination resumes were designed for
candidates with a lot of experience and a well-developed, specialized skill set to showcase.
3.Add a resume header
You've landed on a style and format for your resume. Now it's time to dive into what really makes your resume stand out: the written content.
Your resume should feature an eye-catching resume header at the top of the page to quickly highlight your contact information for hiring managers.
A resume header needs to include your:
a. name
b. email address (use a professional one like firstname.lastname@gmail.com)
c. phone number
You can also add these optional details:
a. an online portfolio or website (if relevant to the job)
b. your LinkedIn
c. your mailing address (if you want to show you're a local)
d. a resume headline (a subtitle that describes your experience)
4. Start your resume with a summary or objective
Hiring managers, especially those at large companies, have many applications to review for each job opening. With so much competition,
it can be tough to make sure your resume gets the attention it deserves.
To stand out to the hiring manager, your resume needs to communicate why you're the right person for the job as quickly as possible. That's
where a convincing resume introduction comes into play.
Your resume introduction provides a quick snapshot of your experience, skills, and qualifications at the very top of your resume.
It should be 3-5 sentences, and can be written in either sentence or bullet-point format.
In 2022, most job seekers use the following types of resume introductions:
a. Resume summary
A resume summary is an introduction that highlights your most impressive professional achievements and skills.
Resume summaries are ideal for candidates with:
-several years of relevant work experience
-accomplishments that can be tied to actual numbers (which give context to those accomplishments)
b. Resume objective
A resume objective focuses on your professional goals and career path, and how they match the company's goals. For this reason, a
resume objective is ideal for candidates who:
-have just graduated from school and lack professional experience
-are writing a career-change resume or internal position
5. Target your work experience to the job ad
Next is your resume's work experience section, which many recruiters and employers are most interested in (so it's important to get it right).
For each work experience entry, list the following basic information:
To make your work experience section shine, target each bullet point to the specific job you want. Look carefully at
the skills mentioned in the description, and showcase any of those skills you have with clear examples.
There are many clues about what the company wants from applicants in this job description. It's up to you to capitalize on them.
Not only does tailoring your experience section to the job ad make your resume more attractive to employers, but it also helps you get through
the applicant tracking system (ATS) software that many large companies use.
ATS software automatically scans your resume for specific skill-related keywords to determine if you're qualified for the role.
If the software doesn't find the keywords it's looking for, it automatically rejects your application before a hiring manager even gets to
see it.

6. Use numbers & action verbs throughout your resume
Many job seekers make the mistake of simply listing past responsibilities in their experience section and resume introduction. Phrases
like "responsible for" and "tasked with" are technically correct, but they don't do a good job of explaining what you accomplished at work.
To make a resume better than those job seekers, instead focus on your achievements, complete with hard numbers that illustrate the
impact of your work.
Here's a comparison of two work experience bullets. The first bullet doesn't use numbers and lacks accomplishments, while the second
bullet provides an achievement and related number:
There are two reasons this second bullet point is effective:
a. It starts with a strong resume action verb. Action verbs catch the hiring manager's eye and make you seem proactive and responsible.
Start all of your bullet points with an action verb to make your application stand out.
b. The candidate includes a hard number. Hard numbers provide context to your accomplishments and show hiring managers what you can
achieve for their company if hired.
c. If you haven't already, consider creating a Google Sheet that tracks the achievements you make at your job.
d. Then next time you want to send out a resume, you can reference these specific numbers to make more compelling work experience bullet
points. Such specific information gives you a better chance of standing out to hiring managers and eventually getting hired.
7. Showcase your skills
Your key skills should be prominently displayed in your resume's skills section to give employers an at-a-glance view of the hard and soft
skills that qualify you for the role.
Hard skills are learned through specific training, workshops, work experience, or school and include the skills you need to operate equipment
at work (like point-of-sale systems).
Soft skills relate to your personality, and you develop them by simply dealing with people and daily tasks while at work. Organizational
skills like coordination and self-management are good examples of soft skills valued by employers.
Include a mix of hard and soft skills on your resume to show employers you have a balance of technical savvy and the ability to work well
with colleagues and clients.
Other places you can highlight your skills
Don't limit your skills to your skills section. Expand on each skill in your resume introduction and work experience bullet points.
For example, if you list Spanish as a key skill, you can talk about how many customers you served in Spanish during a previous position
on a server resume.
Additionally, soft skills should be demonstrated with examples in your experience section, rather than listed in the skills section of
your resume. That's because soft skills are difficult to measure without context, and tell employers very little about your actual abilities.
Measure or rate your skill level
You're likely not an expert at every skill you list on your resume. So how do you communicate your exact level of proficiency to employers?
For hard skills like Photoshop or languages, consider adding an indication of your level of expertise. This indication can either be written
or a visual graphic like a skill bar or graph.
8. Write out your education details
Your education section should normally come after all of your work experience, but you can place it first if you've never held a full-time
job or you're currently a student.
An effective education section on a resume includes only your highest degree. If you didn't go to college, add your high school diploma instead.
You can also add any relevant coursework to your resume if you think it addresses the job ad and the company's needs, or if you're a recent
graduate writing a resume.
This is an example of a resume education section for a job seeker who graduated in 2020 (so it includes more details than you might see on
an experienced professional's resume):
9. Add any additional relevant resume sections
Depending on your experience and background, consider adding optional resume sections. For example, certifications and awards are great if
they're relevant to your chosen career, while hobbies and volunteer work are useful if you're writing a resume with no experience.
Here are some common optional sections you can add to your resume to give hiring managers a more complete view of you as a candidate:
Hobbies and interests
Although they're unlikely to sway an employer's final hiring decision, adding hobbies and interests to your resume helps show off a bit of
your personality and can make your resume stand out.
Additionally, mentioning your hobbies could show hiring managers that you're a good culture fit for the job.
For example, if you're applying for a job at a sporting company like REI, highlighting your passion for camping or fishing is a great way to
show that you'd fit in with the other employees and are personally invested in the company's mission.
Volunteer work
Passionate about volunteering? Putting volunteer work on your resume is a great way to show employers you're engaged with your community and
are interested in more than just a paycheck.
Also, volunteer work is a good addition to your resume if you lack work experience because it shows you have a strong work ethic and are able
to commit your time to something.
If you're a recent graduate or are just starting your career, be sure to include any volunteer experience you have on your resume.
Certifications
If you're applying for jobs that require specific certifications to get hired, you should add a section to your resume clearly highlighting
that you have them.
For example, if you work in education, construction, or engineering, you likely have more than one professional certification. In these fields, it's a good idea to add a certifications section to your resume.
Awards and honors
Whether you've been named "Employee of the Month" or received formal recognition from a professional association, awards and honors make a
great addition to your resume.
Awards show employers that you were highly successful in your previous role, and help you stand apart from other applicants.
Publications
If you work in academia, writing, or law, you've likely published some work under your name, either online or in an academic journal.
Adding a section for publications on your resume shows off some of your relevant work to employers and gives them a reference for the quality
of your writing and research.
Languages
Do you speak three or more languages? Creating a dedicated section for languages on your resume is a good way to show off your skills as a
polyglot.
Being able to speak foreign languages is helpful for many different careers, but you should only add a dedicated section for them if you're
applying for a job where speaking in different languages is highly relevant.
Personal projects
If you're someone who's worked on multiple personal projects, including them on your resume shows employers that you're passionate about
your work and able to motivate yourself.
For example, if you spent a year independently developing an app or game, including programming projects on your resume shows off your
accomplishment to employers and helps explain any gaps in your work experience.
10. Proofread your application (several times)
Finished writing your resume? Don't just fire it off straight away.
Spend some time reading through it at least a couple of times. You'd be surprised how easy it is to make a typo and how hard it is to spot
them in your own writing.
You should also give your resume to a friend or relative to read through so they can help you cut down on common resume writing mistakes.
Software tools you can use to check your resume for grammar or spelling mistakes include:
- Microsoft Word's spell checker
- Grammarly
- Hemingway
11. Save your resume as a PDF
When you're sure your resume is finished and you've checked for errors, you can save it. The best option is to save your resume as a PDF.
PDFs save your formatting even if you use fonts that aren't installed on the hiring manager's computer, so they'll appear exactly as you
want them to appear.
However, if the job ad specifically asks for your resume in Microsoft Word (DOCX) format or some other format, follow those instructions.
Once you've saved your resume, keep it somewhere on your computer. If you're called into an interview, you can then print out hard copies
to hand to your interviewer. You can also refer to your resume if you're writing one for a similar job opening in the future.`
