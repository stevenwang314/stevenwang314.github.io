<!--Head is the first part of the HTML document that is used to add additional information to the HTML document.
Head contains meta information, the title of the page, internal style, external stylesheet link, internal javascript, 
external JavaScript file linking, etc. The head is not required to be present in the document, but it is recommended to be present.
There should only be one head in an HTML document.

The Head is a block of information that is placed at the top of the document. The head is the first section of the document 
and contains information that is shared by all the pages in the document. Head is not used to add information to 
the body of the HTML document. This is because the body is the second part of the HTML document and is used to add content 
to the HTML document.

Head usually contains this <meta>, <title>, <style>, <link>, <base>, and <script>-->

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello there, let me introduce myself. I am Steven Wang and I have recently graduated from <span class="standout-color">California
                    University of Long Beach</span> in Spring 2019 with a Bachelors with a Computer Engineering degree. While I
                    was in college, I have done several hands-on projects in between both software and hardware and
                    making things happen. Over the 4 years I have studied over there, I have received several <span class="standout-color">Dean's list awards</span> from the school university for achieving academic excellence in a semester.</p>
                <p>I am currently working at <span class="standout-color">Volunteers of America</span> with my role is to maintain computers and handling an
                    inventory database. I have developed personal skills from work and myself that universally carries
                    over between now and future. I have dealt with configuring computers such as creating emails for
                    users, setting up new computers for users, as well as troubleshooting computers that are not working
                    properly. I also disposed old and broken computers away by destroying hard drives to prevent misuse
                    of data that could leak from elsewhere. I also have an inventory that contains devices that are
                    currently in use or no longer in use. I worked alongside other workers to be able to solve any
                    issues with computers while being able to finish within a deadline.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I have proficiency in <span class="standout-color">C/C++</span>, and <span class="standout-color">JavaScript.</span> I also have some several hands-on
                    experience onto other programming languages out there such as <span class="standout-color">Python, MATLAB, SQL and Verilog</span>. I can
                    use a version source
                    control called Git to be able to see myself and other changes made to files.
                </p>
                <p>I first got into C++ from a book from my local library as well as also learning it through a course during
                    college. After becoming proficient in C++, I expanded my horizons and started learning how to
                    incorporate them with <span class="standout-color">APIs</span>. First it started with high-level libraries with SFML/SDL but then after
                    I have participated in the Hackathon hosted by Cal-tech in Fall 2018 by making a C/C++ project with
                    a team, it got me motivated more into lower-level APIs such as the entire <span class="standout-color">Windows OS API, DirectX/DirectWrite API</span>, and <span class="standout-color"></span>Boost</span> as
                    it helps me challenge myself to build a modern-day with a windows, GUI, and essential graphics for
                    programs. I eventually successfully build several programs off of them.</p>
                <p>To further expand my own mindset of coding, I then learned Javascript, <span class="standout-color">HTML</span> (Hyper-text markup
                    language), and <span class="standout-color">CSS</span> (Cascading Style Sheets) which not only allows me to build
                    websites, but also allows me to build back-end servers. While learning, I have also
                    created my own website which is this one as a programming exercise. Similar to how I got into C++, I
                    also learned javascript from my library. Eventually, one of my
                    colleagues recommended me a website called freecodecamp.org to learn more about Javascript as well
                    as its libraries that is used to build front and back end. There, it overcame several challenging
                    projects and courses that improved my Javascript more as well as learning valuable libraies along
                    the way.
                </p>
                <p>So far, I have currently learned front end libraries of <span class="standout-color">Bootstrap, JQuery, React, and SASS library</span>,
                    as well as back end with <span class="standout-color">Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and PostgreSQL</span> to build client and server sided
                    apps. While learning <span class="standout-color">PostgreSQL</span> database, I also learned the <span class="standout-color">SQL</span> language to be able to do <span class="standout-color">CRUD</span> (Create,
                    Read, Update, and Delete methods) that I can use to have a powerful database on my skillsets.</a>
                </p>
                <p>On my free time, I like to draw, walking, listening to music, solving sudoku puzzles and various math
                    problems. I also code my own software programs to expand my mindset from time to time.</p>
                <p>I am continuously learning about anything and everything in sight and open to anything out there.</p>
