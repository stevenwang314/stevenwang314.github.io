                    It is then programmed onto a Nexys4 Board. It is done by feeding it lines of instructions and its

                <p class="small-font no-spacing">A Single Cycle Mips Processor is used to execute assembly instructions
                    in one single clock cycle. There are many different instructions that affect registers and values in
                    the memory address in the processor.
                    We extended our Single Cycle Mips Processor by adding more instructions into the processor such as
                    Load Word Increment (LWINC), Exchange (Xch), Multiple (MULT), Divide(DIV), Jump Bit (JB), Jump
                    Carry( JC), and etc. By adding more instructions, we have to modify the structure of our processor
                    in order to incorporate the new instructions to ensure that these extension instructions can be
                    resolved with a single clock cycle.

                    communicate between phone and car while blasting IR signals to perform the communication.
                    We used a terminal to connect our bluetooth between our car and our mobile phone with UART. We used
                    an android app to control our wireless car by using the arrow pads on the app to do so.
                    We first have to setup and configure the HC-05 to be able to pair with the android phone.
                    Our android app allows us to change direction and speed of the car while sending IR signals from our
                    phone to the car.
