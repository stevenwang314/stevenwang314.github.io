                            and over. But what if they want to listen to new songs?
                        </p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Assuming the user has a Spotify Account, the
                            goal of this app is for the user to be able to compile a list of songs they like. The user
                            can either use their own Spotify Account to use their playlist as their list or they can use
                            a search engine in Spotify to grab songs of their choice. In the contrary, the user can
                            create songs they dislike of their choice.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Once the user decides what the like or dislike,
                            they can pick up to 5 songs or artists as a selector to feed to Spotify to generate a list
                            of songs that will be recommended from there. In addition, having more songs on the list
                            does affect the song recommendations even though they are not selected. The user can filter
                            out songs based on popularity. Songs that are not popular will never be selected.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">The user can repeat this step over and over by
                            changing the 5 songs or artists of their own liking. The list of recommended songs will only
                            add songs that are not on the list.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">When the user decides he/she is ready to accept
                            the list, they can click a button that adds ALL of the recommended songs except the songs
                            they dislike into a new playlist directly at an instant. The user then can play the playlist
                            without having to add the songs manually which takes a excruciating amount of time.</p>

                                Bootstrap, Jquery, Spotify API, RESTful API, and Browser’s local storage</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">In order to use Spotify API and their
                                RESTful principles, an access token is required. To get an access token, first I must
                                follow the Authorization Guide by first obtaining an access token through mainly Client
                                Credentials Flow. Second, I also have to create a Spotify app on their dashboard to
                                obtain several sensitive information such as Client Key and Client Secret. I also need a
                                Spotify Account to gain authentication to finally get the Access Token.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">To securely hide the sensitive Client ID and
                                Client Secret, it is stored in a hidden environment variable behind the backend through
                                Node.js. It uses Express to accept request from our front end where it calls GET/POST
                                methods to our back-end we have and receive the messages. There we have two API
                                functions which we have that can authorize the users Spotify account into the app and
                                another one which is used to obtain an access token by using Axios library. Both of
                                these function utilizes the Client ID and Client Secret to hook into Spotify API. Once
                                we get the access token, we finally can use it to call our API calls from Spotify. </p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Getting the access token is automatically
                                called once the user is able to click refresh permission but also an additional time
                                once the access token expires, which is in 1 hour, as there is also a refresh token to
                                get another access token which only happens once.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">In the front-end part of our app, we use the
                                fetch() function to call our Spotify API functions with our access token obtained to be
                                able to search for songs, artists, albums, recommending songs, getting song audio
                                features, and then adding songs to playlist. To be able to constantly update the dynamic
                                list on the webpage, we need to use React whenever we modify the list to update the
                                displayed dynamic list.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">The input we feed it to the Spotify Song
                                recommendation algorithm uses the average of all songs features that are on the favorite
                                songs list from the user followed by the 5 “seeds” from the users’ songs/artists to
                                generate recommended songs. Finally, once the song recommendation list is made, we use
                                the save song to playlist using the Spotify API to directly add them to the playlist
                                directly. </p>

                            properties to handle against 18 different enemies in a map. There are enemies that can
                            weaken towers by making them shoot slower, weaker projectiles, reduce their enemy detection
                            range, as well as not letting them do anything at all. There are also enemies that help
                            boost enemies speed and even force towers to attack a specific enemy. For towers, there are
                            some towers that requires manual casting to deal powerful attack as well as some towers that
                            boost other towers performance.</p>

                            enemy that escapes to the end of the path costs 1 health and the game ends when all health
                            is lost. There isn’t an end to the game but to get as far as possible.</p>

            <p class="small-font no-spacing">The Guitar chord detector is used to detect the type of chord when the
                user plucks a chord from the guitar. The results appears on a Smartphone App through a Bluetooth from
                the HC-05 Bluetooth Module inside our hardware
                where it determines which type of chord has been struck.</p>
            <p class="small-font no-spacing">To perform this, the person first connects the guitar into the hardware and
                attempt to strum a chord. Then, once the processing finished, slide the guitar pick in the smartphone
                app to obtain the detected chord.</p>

                is to replace
                quick flashing strobe of lights in certain videos into a static color to protect the viewer from
                collapsing from a seizure. In this program we used Google Chrome and a youtube video (as demonstration)
                from a clip from
                Pokemon (Dennō Senshi Porygon) that caused hundreds of people to be sent to hospitals due to seizures

                    three channels of Red, Green, and Blue dimension which is then pointed in space.
                    We can compute the distance between two colors through the distance formula. If the distance is
                    bigger, it is shown that the color is changed extremely. This is for one pixel. To be able to cover
                    the entire screen, we have to sum the color distances over the entire region to compute an aggregate

                    me many things. First, it told me to deal with agile coding. Second, we worked together as a group
                    of 3 communicating with each other on what our part of roles we do. And finally, it inspired me to
                    start using Windows API instead of SFML/SDL libraries as a
                    stepping stone to build desktop apps to improve my programming skills. The use of low level
                    libraries taught me to use C-style coding techniques and the low-level libraries allows more freedom
                    to customize the windows such as not showing the window and instead run in the background. In
                    addition, we had the most originality of other projects in the Hackathon because it does not rely on
                    any external libraries of any kind.</p>
