                            <p class="small-font no-spacing">This is my first project made with pure Javascript with
                                HTML for the webpage and CSS to stylize the webpage. It utilizes &lt;canvas&gt; element
                                from
                                HTML greatly to draw out images, shapes, and texts. The images were taken from
                                &lt;img&gt;
                                element while the fonts used are from Google Fonts.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">In the Javascript code, it uses the Document
                                Object Model (DOM) API to interact with HTML element. The use of the DOM API is to fetch
                                the &lt;canvas&gt; element and then we can utilize the canvas functions to draw
                                textures,
                                colored shapes, and text to build up the game. Another use of the DOM API is to be
                                able to add listeners to the mouse, touch, and keyboard inputs to be able to control
                                the player with arrow keys, mouse, and on a mobile device as well as using items
                                whenever the player sends input.</p>

                            and over. But what if they want to listen to new songs?
                        </p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Assuming the user has a Spotify Account, the
                            goal of this app is for the user to be able to compile a list of songs they like. The user
                            can either use their own Spotify Account to use their playlist as their list or they can use
                            a search engine in Spotify to grab songs of their choice. In the contrary, the user can
                            create songs they dislike of their choice.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Once the user decides what the like or dislike,
                            they can pick up to 5 songs or artists as a selector to feed to Spotify to generate a list
                            of songs that will be recommended from there. In addition, having more songs on the list
                            does affect the song recommendations even though they are not selected. The user can filter
                            out songs based on popularity. Songs that are not popular will never be selected.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">The user can repeat this step over and over by
                            changing the 5 songs or artists of their own liking. The list of recommended songs will only
                            add songs that are not on the list.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">When the user decides he/she is ready to accept
                            the list, they can click a button that adds ALL of the recommended songs except the songs
                            they dislike into a new playlist directly at an instant. The user then can play the playlist
                            without having to add the songs manually which takes a excruciating amount of time.</p>

                                Bootstrap, Jquery, Spotify API, RESTful API, and Browser’s local storage</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">In order to use the Spotify API and their
                                RESTful library, an access token is required. To get an access token, the program must
                                follow the Authorization Guide by first obtaining an access token through (in this
                                project) the Authorization Code. Second, I must create a Spotify app on their dashboard
                                to obtain several sensitive information such as Client Key and Client Secret and
                                finally, I need to use an existing Spotify Account to gain authentication to finally get
                                the Access Token.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">As the Client ID and Client Secret cannot be
                                shown in source code, I need a way to hide it from sight. To securely hide the sensitive
                                Client ID and Client Secret, it is stored in a hidden environment variable file behind
                                the server-side part of the app through Node.js. It uses Express to accept request from
                                our own client-side where it calls GET/POST methods to our server side. There the
                                program has two API functions which we implemented that can authorize the users Spotify
                                account into the app and to obtain an access token by using Axios library. Both utilizes
                                the Client ID and Client Secret needed to authenticate the user and then get an
                                authentication code which is needed to hook into Spotify API. Once we get the access
                                token, we finally can use it to call our API calls from Spotify. </p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">In this program, getting the access token is
                                automatically called once the user is able to click the refresh permission button but
                                also an additional time once the access token expires, which is in 1 hour, as there is
                                also a refresh token to get another access token which only happens once per
                                authentication.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">In the front-end part of our app, we use the
                                fetch() function to call our API request with our access token to Spotify API to be able
                                to search for songs, artists, albums, recommending songs, getting song audio features,
                                and then adding songs to playlist endpoints. To be able to constantly update the dynamic
                                list on the webpage whenever the lists are changed from user, it uses React whenever we
                                modify the list to update the displayed dynamic list.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">The input we feed it to the Spotify Song
                                recommendation algorithm uses the average of all songs features that are on the favorite
                                songs list from the user followed by the 5 “seeds” from the users’ songs/artists to the
                                generate recommended songs endpoint. Finally, once the song recommendation list is made,
                                we use the save song to playlist endpoints to directly add them to the playlist
                                directly. </p>

                                Javascript code that is demonstrated in Spotify documentation, I have used C++ language
                                instead to interact through Spotify API endpoints. To get started, I used the built in
                                library from Microsoft that performs HTTP requests called WinHTTP API to do HTTP(s)
                                requests.

                                obtained from the endpoint results from Spotify. There I stored these results through
                                std::map which stores a std::variant data type that which can contain any of the data
                                types such as integer, double, float, string, Boolean, null, an array of std::variant

                        <p class="small-font no-spacing">A tower defense game with 20 towers each having specific unique
                            properties to handle against 18 different enemies in a map. There are enemies that can
                            weaken towers by making them shoot slower, weaker projectiles, reduce their enemy detection
                            range, as well as not letting them do anything at all. There are also enemies that help
                            boost enemies speed and even force towers to attack a specific enemy. For towers, there are
                            some towers that requires manual casting to deal powerful attack as well as some towers that
                            boost other towers performance.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Other than that, normal tower defense rules still apply. The player spends gold to build towers as well as upgrading towers to improve their stats. The goal is to prevent the enemies reach the exit path. Each enemy that escapes to the end of the path costs 1 health and the game ends when all health is lost. With each new wave features newer enemies as well have an ever increasing health. There isn’t an end to the game but to get as far as possible.</p>

To differentiate different towers and enemies, each tower and enemy uses the inheritance technique that inherits the base turret/enemy class and override some of its properties for its own custom implementation. </p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Angled collision is common especially when turrets are facing at an angle. For the projectiles to be able to handle angled collision correctly, it uses the Separate Axis Theorem which allows concave shapes collisions by using each of its vertices on two objects to project an axis between each other.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Another issue is where when there are more towers and enemies on the screen as the game progress which results in more redundant Collison checks which leads to reduced performance of the program. To reduce the collision checks, I have implemented a Spatial Hash which is a hash table that divides parts of the world space into a list for that particular chunk. To be able to get objects at that particular rectangle, we access the Spatial Hash using positions from 4 corners and aggregate it into an object list. Instead of checking all enemies (regardless of position), we only check only enemies that are roughly near a particular rectangle which improves our game performance.</p>

                            this project. One of them is the traditional combat system related to Health, Attack, and
                            Defense where the player can fight enemies with either their regular attack or 4 other
                            skills. The player can explore through different areas while encountering a variety of
                            different enemies and also 1 boss enemy. Some of the enemies can apply status effect on the
                            player making them weaker, move slower, stop the player’s movement, or slowly deplete the
                            players health bar. The player gains experiences and even levels for each enemy it slays to
                            become stronger over time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Then, there is an Inventory system where the
                            player can store a finite number of items that ranges from equips, consumables, and even
                            junk. The player can improve their own stats from equips and consumables help assist the
                            player while he/she is fighting against enemies. Second there are NPC (Non-player
                            characters) that the player can talk to. For instance, A shop NPC provides items that the
                            player to buy or items that can sell to it. Another is a quest NPC that assigns the player
                            to do a certain task and if they do finish their tasks, the player receives a set of
                            experience and gold.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">Additionally, there are breakable boxes that the
                            player can destroy in the beginning to get some items. The boxes do respawn after a certain
                            period of time when the player breaks them.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">The game is saved when the game closes. The file

                            narrows down possible candidates to a few in which the user can finish the puzzle off
                            easier. Or if the user wants to save time, the person can use auto-fill candidates to fill
                            ALL possible candidates in the entire puzzle so they don’t have to write themselves.</p>
                        <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">In case of an error, the program will detect

                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">In order to solve any sudoku puzzles (including the hardest sudoku puzzles out there), I have used the modified Backtrack Algorithm. The modifications to the Backtrack Algorithm are that first it will eliminate candidate numbers that does not fit in either row, column, or region in that particular cell. Next it will identify Naked/Hidden Singles and Intersection Row/Column techniques that will further reduce candidates possible. This significantly improves the algorithm speed as there will be less possible cases possible in a particular possible.</p>
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">To generate a brand new sudoku puzzle, first the algorithm will remove all numbers from the sudoku puzzle and then shuffles the order of candidates in all 81 cells. Then, from top-left cell to the bottom-right cell. The algorithm will choose the first cell and fills it out normally while eliminating that particular number in its row, column, and region cell. This continues until the puzzle is finished or until there is no possible candidate cells at that location. If there aren’t any possible candidate cells, the algorithm will backtrack, going back to the previous cell and remove the select candidate cell from earlier and pick the next candidate cell in the list. Once the puzzle is fully filled, it will remove numbers at random cell location and attempts to solve the puzzle using the modified backtrack algorithm to solve it back but this time, the modified backtrack algorithm continues after getting a solution so that it can find more than 1 solution in that puzzle in which it will backtrack normally and continue on. If the removed number causes the puzzle to get 2 solutions or more, the number erased will be put back and will no longer be selected for removal anymore and the removal continues. This removal continues until all cells are considered or until it removes an specific amount of cells. </p>                       
                            <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">To be able to solve sudoku puzzle using numbers logic, it is much harder to implement then modified Backtrack algorithm. To be able to get started, I had to create several arrays which are number of candidates, list of singles, pairs, triples, and quads, as well as candidates that remain in all row, column, and region. This allowed me to make Naked/hidden single, pairs, triples, and quads, intersections (pointing/claiming), X, XY, XYZ, W wings, Swordfish, and Simple Coloring. This has been extremely challenging for me as it is extremely hard to debug and find errors due to a 2d array of 9x9 making it hard to find which index were changed and so on.</p>

In this program we used Google Chrome and a Youtube video (as demonstration) from a clip from Pokemon (Dennō Senshi Porygon) that caused hundreds of people to be sent to hospitals due to seizures caused in that episode.

The color has three channels of red, green, and blue dimension which is then pointed in space. We can compute the distance between two colors through the distance formula. If the distance is bigger, it is shown that the color is changed extremely. This is for one pixel. To be able to cover the entire screen, we have to sum the color distances over the entire region to compute an aggregate between two frames.</p>

                <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">It records number of times within 200ms period that color difference reaches a specific threshold. If this threshold activates 3 times, it is marked as flashing. We used GDI (Graphics Development Interface) to draw a red rectangle over the region.</p>

                <summary><b>Self-Reflections</b></summary>
                <p class="small-font no-spacing">I had lots of fun participating in the Cal-Tech Hackathon that happened on March 2019. The project we have done has finished and demo successfully within a 48-hour timeframe and is made with 4 people including myself.</p>
                <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">I have developed some skills while I was at Hackathon. With only 48 hours to come up and make a project, we learned how to be agile developers as 48 hours is not a lot.  We had to manage time wisely as we had to spend time researching the libraries functions and algorithms, implementing the code, then test the results and fix things when necessary. It gets very nervous for us near the end especially in the final moments when the solid color to block epilepsy won’t show up when needed. </p>
                <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">The second mindset is that I am open to learning new things. When we decided to build a seizure flash blocker project as a group, all of us are familiar with C/C++ though we decided to expand our horizons and pick up libraries and algorithms that are out of our comfort zone such as using Windows API and GDI (Graphics Development Interface) API and then innovating the project around those API to be able to produce creative projects from our own minds.</p>
                <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">The third skill is using our debugger to test whether the output of our values was correct. Especially when we are using the Aggregate color distance algorithm, we learned how use Watches to watch the difference of RGB pixels while we are playing the Pokemon Clip. Another is using the Call stack which is vital as we can see where the function is being called from and also why it is being called so that we can easily go back to the function being called and fix an issue. Without our newly found debugging skills, we would never know what went wrong and that could prevent us from finishing our project within the last few hours.</p>
                <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">The fourth skill is code documentation, code documentation is very vital as not only we understand the code, other people will read our source code to see what is going on. We described each piece of code on what it does as well as writing a brief description of the source code file. Not just code documentation but also writing a report on what we did to explain to the average person what our project has done.</p>
                <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">And finally, it shows us that we are willing to be motivated. Even attending a Hackathon has describe me that I am willing to take a new challenge and ready to tackle that challenge. With our sheer motivation, no matter the situation caused during our time at the Hackathon, we never gave up as a group and continue to push forward until the project is complete. Lots of times that the project never worked out even though we fully implemented the skeleton of the project. Instead, we spend our time from day to night to analyze and inspect pieces of code that wasn’t working and eventually, we were able to fix the issue.  </p>
                <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">After the Hackathon, it inspired me to start using Windows API and GDI instead of SFML/SDL libraries as a stepping stone to build my own personal desktop apps to improve my programming skills. The usage of these low-level APIs were memorable and they have used into my projects as of today. These low-level libraries taught me to use C-style coding techniques and allowing more freedom to customize the windows such as not showing the window and instead run in the background and grabbing current processes that are currently running on the computer. All the skills I learned in Hackathon made me improved me in every way.</p>
                <p class="small-font no-spacing bottom-spacing">We had the most originality score compared to other projects in Hackathon because of not relying on any external libraries and using what is built in on Windows Operating System.</p>

                    documentating code is the most vital part as it help me remember what a piece of code does. Finally,
                    writing a Chip specification taught me to write better grammer as well as allowing me to organize

            <p class="small-font no-spacing">In this project we used Bluetooth through HC-05 on our car to
                communicate between phone and car while blasting IR signals to perform the communication.
                We used a terminal to connect our bluetooth between our car and our mobile phone with UART. We used
                an android app to control our wireless car by using the arrow pads on the app to do so.
                We first have to setup and configure the HC-05 to be able to pair with the android phone.
                Our android app allows us to change direction and speed of the car while sending IR signals from our
                phone to the car.
